<h1>Recruitment Interview - I</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Had a call with an engineer from a wannabe employer yesterday.
    
    Didn't expect to get into deep technical detail on the first call, but did anyway.
    
    Didn't went to smooth.
    I guess the engineer was expecting to talk to a graduate student who did nothing but compare sorting algorithms and data structures.
    
    They had a pretty specific problem and wanted me to write code ... over the phone.
    
    So I asked a few questions and calculated the magnitude of the problem  (worst case: 4^7).
    Got into a little "fight" with him over that, since I was sure that would average around 10K and he insisted it  was more like 3billion.
    Well, 4^7 = 2^7 * 2^7 = 2^14 ... and I guess every programmer can tell you what 2^14 is ... 16K.
    
    Nevermind,
    so I decided to do the dummy brute force implementation (telling him that you could always tune that later).
    He didn't believe that this would work.
    
    Well, I took my notes today during my lunchbreak and had a working version about 10 minutes later.
    (No googling for the answer ... I had to prove it to myself !)
    
    Took about 14 seconds ... slow.
    So I changed just a tiny bit of code ... about 10 lines, replacing my brute force lookup with a simple hashtable.
    And went down to 20ms :)
    
    No black magic.
    
    The problem through the whole call was:
    The last few years I did (mostly) very high level design and architecture.
    When I needed an implementation I used the simplest one I could think of.
    Then I gave the simple (100% working) version to one of my interns and they applied all the nasty tricks.
    In the end I only had to verify their results against my solution.
    
    But I digress.
    He was trying to make solve a problem that would be far to easy for 15 year old schoolkid.
    (No problem here!)
    But he expected me to explain my answer like a 15 year old schoolkid.
    
    Imaging a car designer explaining to you how to clean out your fuel pump ;)
    
    At the end he asked me for "the nastiest bug" I've ever seen.
    I guess they expected to tell them about "the nastiest bug" I ever produced.
    Problem:
    I never produced a nasty bug.
    Usually my "bugs" are something like "missing closing brackets" or "missing semicolons" which are usually caught by the compiler anyway.
    
    Sometimes I create "off by ones", but I believe in unit-testing so they are caught pretty early, usually within 5 minutes after I produce them.
    
    Well, in the end I thought I was to stupid to solve an easy problem,
    but 20 minutes after the call I had the perfect solution in my head :)
    
    Communication problems.
    
    I'd say his expectations were wrong.
    And I assumed he would know what he's doing ... totally confusing me with some of his "hints".
    And I guess I was just a tiny little bit nervous.
    
    You know I get calls from headhunters about once every other week,
    but I always declined, since I love my job here.
    
    But this job ... I wanted.
    
    Wait and see ... they'll give me a second chance!
