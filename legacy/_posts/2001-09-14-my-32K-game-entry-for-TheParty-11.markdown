<h1>my 32K game entry for TheParty 11</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Is history.<br />
    <br />
    The last 3 month I've been writing a "Save New York" clone.<br />
    You remember that old C64 game ?<br />
    <br />
    You were a jet pilot that was supposed to shoot the aliens and keep them from destroying the skyscrapers.<br />
    <br />
    Well,<br />
    everybody who ever played it will surely know who usually destroyed what.<br />
    <br />
    This(=my) version had an improved building-destruction engine and authentic skylines.<br />
    <br />
    I decided to do an "rm -rf" on the CVS repository of it.<br />
    (It's just not right to flight planes into buildings.)<br />
    It's gone .... <br />
    <br />
    It hurts, but I lost some friends last tuesday - and that hurts a lot more.<br />
    <br />
