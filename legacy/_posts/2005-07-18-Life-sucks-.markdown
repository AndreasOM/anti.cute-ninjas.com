<h1>Life sucks ...</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    ... but some things suck more.
    
    Last week I had a little discussion with my manager.
    At the core of it there was some "mobbing" from one of my coworkers.
    
    What the argument boiled down to ?
    
    My boss told me that - due to my health problem - I was working only to 75% of what I was capable of the years before.
    Due to this I <strong>only</strong> did my work.
    I <strong>didn't</strong> help out others with their work.
    So the <strong>others</strong> didn't finish <strong>their</strong> work.
    And the schedule slipped.
    
    <em>Now wait a second!</em>
    I did my work. They didn't.
    
    I usually can do 150% of the average Joe here at the office.
    The <em>other guy</em> usually can do about 80% of Joe.
    Right now I'm doing 75% of 150% ... so that's around 110% of Joe.
    The other guy does 100% of 80% ... so that's around 80% of Joe.
    
    Now that's fine. Not everbody can excel.
    But ... my boss warned me that my rating will be not that good this year.
    Urgs ... one moment.
    
    Just to keep things simple.
    
    Jack is a A-Student and brings home a B(+) ... is allowance is cut by his dad.
    John is a D-Student and brings home a C ... his allowance is doubled by his dad.
    
    Did I mention:
    They started exactly at  the same allowance.
    They are brothers.
    
    Yes, all of us who have little brothers/sisters have been there.
    But this is a manager ... he earns a living by making the right decisions.
    
    And it's not even that I don't <strong>want to</strong> do the 150% I used to do.
    And simply can't reach them anymore.
    Getting past 70% is giving me horrible pain.
    I just to it since I feel I get paid 100% so I should reach that.
    
    Well, life sucks...
