<h1>EQOA</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I bought myself Everquest Online Adventures for my PStwo as a birthday present.
    
    90 minutes ago I put it in and tried to logon.
    Everything went (fairly) smooth up to the point where I tried to enter my account key.
    Bang.
    
    "Invalid Key".
    So I contacted customer support.
    The first guy kicked me out after about 25 minutes, telling me to "fax a copy of the receipt".
    
    So I phoned them ... only to be told that "this number is for hardware support only".
    So why do they print it in the software manual ?
    
    Right now I'm in chat with another CSR.
    These guys are so slow...
