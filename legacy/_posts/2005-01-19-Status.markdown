it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    News for you ;)
    
    Went to a Chakra Therapist on Tuesday.
    My 1st and 2nd Chakra are without energy.
    
    I know this seems to be going more and more esoterik,
    but this is the stuff that seems to help the most.
    
    She told me it will be a lot of hard work to fix that.
    And I believe her.
    This time she just slightly put her hand on my back
    and all I wanted to do is jump of the table and run away.
    I didn't, but after a while I started to cry.
    
    Still don't have the results from the food test...
