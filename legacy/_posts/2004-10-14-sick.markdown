Sorry!)

    Yes,
    
    you might have guessed it (again ?).
    
    I'm still sick.
    The cortison is helping a little,
    but now the side effects are starting to get bad.
    
    Another week to go till we'll reduce the drugs I'm taking.
    
    Maybe I'll feel alive again by x-mas...
