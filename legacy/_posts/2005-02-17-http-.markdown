<h1>http ?</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I stumbled across this a few times.
    
    When I enter <a href="http://http://www.google.de/">http://http://www.google.de/</a> into my location bar (or click a link containing the double http://) I end up at ...
    
    ... just wait.
    Why would anybody do this anyway ?
    Well, some webforms prepend http:// if you enter an URL (and tell you to ommit it),
    but they don't check if you already prepended it.
    
    So that site gets a lot of traffic.
    
    And the winner is ?
    
    microsoft.com
    
    I'm not sure (yet) why, but I'm sure you will tell me...
