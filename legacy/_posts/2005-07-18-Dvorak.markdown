<h1>Dvorak</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I used to use a dvorak-keyboard layout a few years ago,
    but never managed to map the "Umlauts".
    
    <a href="http://www.chaosdorf.de/~pylon/cgi-bin/blog.cgi/Computer/Dvorak/switchto_dvorak.comments">Pylon</a> has a nice layout with Umlauts.
    
    And there is a really nice <a href="http://www.gigliwood.com/abcd/">tutorial</a>.
    
    Hmmm ... seems that I still can type quite good ;)
