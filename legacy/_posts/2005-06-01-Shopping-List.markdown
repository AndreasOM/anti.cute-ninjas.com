<h1>Shopping List</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I know that I should be saving my money,
    but the low dollar exchange rate is making it hard to not buy.
    
    So here is my shopping list:
    iPod shuffle (512MB) ~98$ -> 80Euro (saved: 18 Euro)
    External (USB+Firewire) 3.5" dard drive enclosure ~30$ -> 25Euro (saved: 15 Euro)
    (maybe) 80GB HD for above enclosure
    
    
    2 pairs of vans
    2 pairs of dockers
    some shirts
    2 pairs of shorts
    sunglasses
