<h1>Scotland - Treatment 7</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Just had my seventh treatment.
    It's my fourth trip to scotland.
    
    My therpist and I agree, that my symptoms improved by around 80%.
    With another treatment coming up this thursday,
    I'm afraid that there will be nothing to fix for the Stanford guys in june ;)
