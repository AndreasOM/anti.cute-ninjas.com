<h1>GKrellMMS and big playlists ... sorry</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I never hit the problem,<br />
    but apparently last weeks gkrellmms patch broke the whole thing.<br />
    It only occured when you closed xmms or cleaned the playlist.<br />
    (My playlist is so long, that I simple never changed it.)<br />
    <br />
    Here's the <a href="http://www.webhome.de/anti/patches/gkrellmms-0.5.5-icon-fix.patch">fix</a><br />
    <br />
    <b>Note:</b> You'll need the original patch and this fix.<br />
    I'll create a cummulative patch within the next days.
