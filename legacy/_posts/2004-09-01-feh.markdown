(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Tom started playing around with feh again.

    I hope he will apply the <a href="/patches/feh-1.2.6-anti-lock.patch">screen lock patch</a> (that I 've sent to him yesterday) before he releases a new version.
    
    I really like adding functionallity to tools I use every day,
    but I hate to keep track of my patches ;)
