<h1>Announcing WordPress 1.5</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2005/02/strayhorn/">WordPress 1.5</a> is out ... and that can only mean one thing:
    
    <b>I need to upgrade!</b>
