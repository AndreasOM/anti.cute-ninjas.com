<h1>Scotland Vaction</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    This is the planned schedule ... so far:
    Wednesday 20th:
    Drive from Stuttgart to Frankfurt (Hahn)
    Fly to Glasgow (Prestwik)
    Train to Glasgow (Central)
    Bus to Edinburgh
    Stay at a friends friend
