<h1>Not dead</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Well, not really, but kind of.
    
    Just "fixed" the deliciousizer.
    It seemed a good idea to add the post id to the tags.
    It wasn't.
    Now I got thousands of tags ....
    
    It's gone.
    Now I only have to clean up the old posts...
