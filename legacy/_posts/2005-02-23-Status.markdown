<h1>Status</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I'm still alive.
    My health didn't get worse, but it also didn't get better.
    
    Flying to scotland again next week.
    I hope that will really improve things ... again.
    
    Doing a lot of "esoterik" stuff - stones, light, oils - maybe it helps... and I'm sure it won't make things worse.
