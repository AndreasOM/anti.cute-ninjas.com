<h1>Getting better...</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I really think things are improving.
    Started to get rid of the quicksilver in my body
    with algae capsules.
    
    Had a myreflex therapy last friday.
    And apart from a cold I had a pretty good weekend.
    Even had some sex ... and lasted almost 5 minutes ... which is a big improvement over the 15 seconds from the last try...
    
    My right buttock muscle is sore like hell, but I'm sure it will get better.
    
    Had a "chakra therapy" today - but I'm not even sure if I should call it that.
    I could feel the bones in my spine shift.
    She told me it might worsen the next few days,
    but we are getting there.
    
    All in all I'm pretty sure we are on the right track.
    And I will get really good again.
    It might be a while, but I'll be OK.
