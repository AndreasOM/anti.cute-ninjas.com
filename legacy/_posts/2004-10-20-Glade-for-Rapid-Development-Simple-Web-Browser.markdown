<h1>Glade# for Rapid Development: Simple Web Browser</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I wrote a small application using mono, glade# and gecko#.
    
    Take a look at this -->
    <a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~edasque/projects/Tutorial/glade2.html">Glade# for Rapid Development: Simple Web Browser</a>
    to get some inspiration.
    
    Now the only problem is, that I can't access the page source :(
    Will need to find a way to solve that.

    I asked the question on netscape.public.mozilla.embedding
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=de&lr=&group=netscape.public.mozilla.embedding&c2coff=1&selm=b3dcc7c9.0410201252.6414d837%40posting.google.com">"gecko-sharp, access page source"</a> 
    Maybe someone knows the solution.
