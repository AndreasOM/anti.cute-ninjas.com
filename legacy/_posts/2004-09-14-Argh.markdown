(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I feel bad.
    The doc said depressions are normal with this kind of infection,
    but this is not a depression. It's a DEEEEEEPRESSION.
    
    Stayed at home today.
    My digestive system is reacting to the antibiotika in a bad way...
