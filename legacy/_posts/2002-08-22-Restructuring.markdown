title: "Restructuring"
---

I got a new (cheap and big) host to put all the large stuff (screenshots, photos, files, etc) on.
This needed a bit of restructuring.
The photo lists are now built via xslt (xalan) and wml,
not nice, but functional.
I'll have to redo the whole photo thingy database driven,
but that is for later.
