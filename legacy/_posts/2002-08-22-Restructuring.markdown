<h1>Restructuring</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I got a new (cheap and big) host to put all the large stuff (screenshots, photos, files, etc) on.<br />
    <br />
    This needed a bit of restructuring.<br />
    <br />
    The photo lists are now built via xslt (xalan) and wml,<br />
    not nice, but functional.<br />
    <br />
    I'll have to redo the whole photo thingy database driven,<br />
    but that is for later.<br />
