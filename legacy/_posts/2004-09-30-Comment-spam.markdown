<h1>Comment spam</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I got some comment spam over the last weeks and I was getting tired of removing/disapproving it manually,
    so I installed this:
    <a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2004/09/24/three-strikes-and-out-damned-spam-out-i-say/">Threestrikes Spam blocker</a>
    
    If you try to comment and end up on the fbi site, let me know.
