(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    About three month ago one page of our <a href="http://www.schwarzes-forum.de/">Gothic Forum</a> was indexed:
    <a href="http://anti.cute-ninjas.com/wp/archives/2004/07/19/110/">anti's blog » Schwarzes Forum</a>
    
    Now we have
    <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&q=allinurl%3Aschwarzes-forum.de+site%3Awww.schwarzes-forum.de&btnG=Search">857</a>
    
    and
    <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=link%3Awww.schwarzes-forum.de&btnG=Search">7 Links</a>
    
    Page Rank seems to be 3/10.
