(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Had a bad flare up on friday.
    I managed to keep it under control,
    but it's still bad.
    
    I guess I'm at 50% (from the overall maximum) right now.
    Doesn't sound too bad, but considering that I was running around 15-20% for the last few weeks,
    makes this the worst I've been through for a while.
    
    And keep in mind that the "I could live with this if I really had no other choice"-level would be about 1-2%.
    
    Let's just say it's bad.
    
    But I'm flying to California tomorrow.
    And I'm pretty sure they will fix it for good :)
