<h1>Hypnosis and Selftreatment</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I promised to come back about how the selfhypnosisi is working.
    
    The truth?
    I can't tell you. At least not yet.
    
    Each session needs one hour and I need to do at least 15 of them before anything (really measurable) is expected to happen.
    I had 4 sessions so far ... and I feel more relaxed, so that is good.
    
    I also started to treat my (internal) trigger points myself.
    I know what to do and where to do it.
    The spot is just a little bit hard to reach.
    
    I had two (10minute) sessions last saturday and two more on monday.
    I plan to get into a Monday-Wednesday-Friday rythm.
    
    I know two things about these sessions:
    a) they hurt like hell.
    b) they help!
