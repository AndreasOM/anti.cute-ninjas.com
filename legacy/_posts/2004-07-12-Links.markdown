<h1>Links</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    URLs now should be "auto linked" (i.e. changed into HREFs).
    And they should be changed into google redirections.
    
    Let's try:
    http://fake.cute-ninjas.com/
    
    [update]
    The autolink works, but not the google redir :(
    
    Let's try this:
    <a href="http://fake.cute-ninjas.com/">Fake @ Cute-Ninjas</a>
    
    [update 2]
