(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    So everybody seems to be pretty hyped about the new iPod.
    OK, the specs look alright;
    And the price is cheap ... considering the included Apple-TAX.
    
    But after recent experiences with Apples-Support and -Service I'll keep as far away from iPods as I possibly can.
    
    If I get one for free, I'll probably use it for some gravitational experiments...
