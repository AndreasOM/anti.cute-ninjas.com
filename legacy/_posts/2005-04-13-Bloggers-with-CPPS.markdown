<h1>Bloggers with CPPS</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Hmmm ... just checkd Technorati for <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/CPPS" rel="tag">CPPS</a> and it looks like no one else is blogging about this "disease".
    
    I thought maybe <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/prostatitis" rel="tag">prostatitis</a> is more popular,
    but there is no hit at all.
    
    Am I the only one with this problem ?
    
    Maybe this helps to spread awareness a little:
