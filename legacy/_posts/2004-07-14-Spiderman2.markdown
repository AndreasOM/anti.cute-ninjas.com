(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Watched Spiderman 2 yesterday.
    
    Good movie.
    At first I was a bit disappointed by the animations of spidey,
    but the style fit pretty good in the overall movie style,
    so that's ok.
    
    The story was a bit too "poor spidey/peter" for me.
    Some stuff was totally unbelievable,
    but it's a comic here after all.
    
    Worth a look.
    
    I might even buy the DVD once it's out...
