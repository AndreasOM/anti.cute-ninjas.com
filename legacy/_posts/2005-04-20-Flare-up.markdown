<h1>Flare up</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Had a flare up over the last few days.
    
    It started saturday afternoon and is slowly going back to normal.
    On the good side:
    My insurrance finaly decided that it might actually be a good idea to go to Stanford to get fixed.
    I already talked to Dr. Wise and it looks like I'll be participating in the june clinic.
    
    On a side note:
    I got a (small) herpes upsring on my lip. Nothing major.
    But actually I'm almost happy about it. Ever since this CPPS problem started I didn't have any trouble with herpes.
    Doctors told me that I had "found a new outlet for [my] anxiety". So maybe this is a sign that things are going back to normal.
    Or maybe not ... we'll  see...
