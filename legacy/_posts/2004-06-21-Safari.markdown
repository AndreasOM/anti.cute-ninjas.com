<h1>Safari</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Just let <a href="http://www.danvine.com/icapture/">iCapture</a> do a quick preview of my site in safari.
    
    It looks almost perfect:
    <a href="http://anti.cute-ninjas.com/images/site/safari-2004-06-21.png"><img src="http://anti.cute-ninjas.com/images/site/th_safari-2004-06-21.png" alt="anti's world in safari" /></a>
    
    The navbox on the right is too big,
    but that's going to go away very soon anyway.
