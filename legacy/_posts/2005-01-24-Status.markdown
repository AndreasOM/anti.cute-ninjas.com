<h1>Status</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I know.
    I know.
    
    Updates are coming slow.
    
    Last week I got the results from the food "incompatibility" test.
    
    Milk is very bad.
    Inlcuding cheese, yoguhrt and anything else made from cheese.
    
    Tuna fish is also bad.
    
    Agar-Agar is another thing I should avoid.
    
    Other than that there was only stuff that I don't eat anyway.
    Lobster ... clams ...
    
    My dentist started to remove the amalgam fillings last week.
    There is only one left (on the lower left)
    and the metallic tast was gone immediatly.
    
    On thursday evening my throat swell shut again.
    And this time it was visible from the outside.
    
    I'm leaving for Edinburgh later today.
    Got two appointments with a physiotherapist this week.
    
    I'll tell you about the results later...
