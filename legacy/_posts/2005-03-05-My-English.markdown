(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Just did a quick <a href="http://www.okcupid.com/tests/take?testid=14457200288064322170">test</a> on my english skills. The Result ?
    
    Inter-Advanced
    You scored 73% Beginner, 100% Intermediate, 87% Advanced, and 72% Expert!
    
    You have a good understanding of intermediate and advanced commonly confused English words, getting at least 75% of the intermediate and advanced level questions correct. The puzzling part of your test result is the fact that you only answered 75% or less correct in the beginner section. Fascinating.
    
    Compared to users who took the test and are and in your age group:
    
        * 100% had lower Beginner scores.
        * 100% had lower Intermediate scores.
        * 100% had lower Advanced scores.
        * 100% had lower Expert scores.
    
    
    
    Looks like my English is pretty good ... for a non native speaker...
