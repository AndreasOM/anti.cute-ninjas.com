(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I got it working. Stable.<br />
    But I had to disable AGP (BIOS).<br />
    Now it's almost unusable slow in 2D mode.<br />
    I guess I'll have to invest some money into a GeForce2 (now that the 4 is announced I'm sure prices will drop).<br />
