<h1>Blue Control - Lost</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    OK.
    
    As expected. I lost.
    
    First match (0-2).
    
    Game 1
    Drew 4 islands and 3 counters.
    Not to shabby - I though.
    But I kept drawing islands for 5 rounds and by then it was over.
    
    Game 2
    Drew 2 island, 3 counters and 2 creatures.
    Better ?
    Nope. Didnt' draw any land for the next 6 rounds.
    Game over.
    
    Second match (1-2)
    Won the first round.
    Simple control.
    Lost the second one due to missing mana ... control against a defense grid withoit mana ?
    Not a chance.
    Round 3.
    Three defense grids on the other side of the board.
    Pulled up an Echoing Ruin after I died.
    
    Third match (0-2)
    Lost against a Psychatog deck.
    
    5 points :)
