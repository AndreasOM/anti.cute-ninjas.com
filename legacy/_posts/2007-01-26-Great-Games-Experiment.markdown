<h1>Great Games Experiment</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I just joined the great games experiment.

    The site looks really slick.
    It might prove to be a good place to get in contact with other developers,
    but also with probable publishers and gamers/testers.
    
    If nothing else, it's at least another way to get some players ;)
