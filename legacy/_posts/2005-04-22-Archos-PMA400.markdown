<h1>Archos - PMA400</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    A good friend (mambo) just ordered an PMA400 and (after a little nagging) started a blog about it.
    If you can read german: <a href="http://pma400.cute-ninjas.com/">Archos PMA400 Blog</a>.
    
    I'm pretty sure he's going to develop some nice apps for it :)
    
    That is <a href="http://pma400.cute-ninjas.com/archives/2005/04/22/2/pma400-bestellt/">once he received it</a>...
