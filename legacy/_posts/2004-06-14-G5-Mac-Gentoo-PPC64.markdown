<h1>G5 Mac - Gentoo - PPC64</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Got a G5 Mac a few hours ago.
    Wiped out OSX and started to install Gentoo.
    
    <a href="http://adelie.polymtl.ca/experimental/ppc64/livecd/install-ppc64-G5-minimal-2004.1.iso.gz">LiveCD</a>
    and
    <a href="http://adelie.polymtl.ca/experimental/ppc64/stages/stage2-ppc64-20040520.tar.bz2">Stage2 tarball</a>
    
    Happily building glibc right now.
    
    Remember use the openfirmware shell (ALT-APPLE-o-f) to boot from CD if you simply don't manage to hit "c"-key at the right moment.
    To open the CD-Drive use the "eject" button on the keyboard.
    
    MACs are sooooo user friendly.
    It's all very intuitve ... not.
