<h1>Smart</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Looks like the <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/002565.html">Ugly Car</a> is finally coming to the US.
    So there isn't any place to hide anymore.
    
    FYI:
    The SMART headquarter is located about 5 miles from here.
    I worked in that building while I studied at university.
