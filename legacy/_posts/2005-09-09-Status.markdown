(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I just came back from a trip to scotland.
    
    The PT was pretty painful. 6 weeks in between treatments is just too much :(
    
    My next trip will be in three weeks.
    I hope this will be fixed some day.
    
    All other stuff is just slowly limping along.
    
    Sorry, nothing fancy going on in my life right now.
    
    Well,
    we found the loft we always wanted,
    now we only need the money.
    (But that's almost settled :) )
