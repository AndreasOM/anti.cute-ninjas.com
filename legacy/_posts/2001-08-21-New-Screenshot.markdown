<h1>New Screenshot</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    When I saw the new Buell last week, I just had to do this:<br />
    <a href="http://www.webhome.de/anti/SHOTS/index.html"><img src="http://www.webhome.de/anti/SHOTS/tiny_shot_01-08-21_173447.png"></a><br />
    If enough people want that background I'll clean it up and upload it.<br />
    <br />
