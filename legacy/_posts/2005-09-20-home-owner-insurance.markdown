<h1>home owner insurance</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    One thing that we totally overlooked when shopping for the new loft,
    was home owner insurance.
    
    You absolutly need one :(
    
    There is no way to own a property without home owner insurance.
    Looks like I will have to start shopping around.
    
    An hour ago I never thought about home owner insurance and now I find out what it is ;)
    I'm not sure what the local equivalent to
    H-1, H-2, H-3, H-4, H-5 and H-6 is,
    but I don't want to waste my money in case of
    flooding, fire, etc.
