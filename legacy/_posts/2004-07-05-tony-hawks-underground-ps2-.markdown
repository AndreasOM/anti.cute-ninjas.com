<h1>tony hawks underground (ps2)</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I bought the game last thursday.
    I'm about 70% through, without any major problems.
    
    The german translation sucks a bit here and there, making it hard to some goals.
    For Example:
    To improve manual stats:
    "Zeige 3 Manuals in einer Combo"
    (Do 3 manuals in one combo).
    Well, I did about 10 in one combo, but my stats didn't increase.
    So I was looking for a FAQ, but I only found this one:
    <a href="http://www.supercheats.com/playstation2/walkthroughs/tonyhawksunderground-walkthrough02.txt">thug - walkthrough - ps2</a>
    
    Didn't read too deep into it, since I don't want to spoil the game...
