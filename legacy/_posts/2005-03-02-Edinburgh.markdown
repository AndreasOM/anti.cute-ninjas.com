<h1>Edinburgh</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I'm still in Embra.
    Sitting atop of Caffe Nero in Princess Street.
    The internet link up is fast ... if a bit expensive at about 5 quid a day.
    
    It's very cold outside, but I have to take a lunch break sometime later.
    Might even take a tour of the National Gallery of Modern Art. They have an Andy Warhole exhibistion on right now.
    
    Or I'll just sit here the whole afternoon.
    The problem is that they only have about four power outlets, so once you leave you mind find yourself coming back
    with an empty battery and now power :(
