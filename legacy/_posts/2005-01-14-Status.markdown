<h1>Status</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    One of my docs had an old friend there this week, who is already pensioner.
    He looked at me and told me that the root of the whole problem might be:
    amalgam
    (It's used for fillings and 50% quicksilver).
    We're gonna check that next monday.
    
    Other doc had the results of the food screening.
    I had very high intolerance against something in the "base" group,
    so we decided to have a detailed report done.
    
    Today I visited a dentist (specialized in removing amalgam).
    Made some X-Rays. He will make a plan.
    
    On monday the replacement doing the Myoreflex, while my practioner is on vacation,
    told me that she won't take my money anymore since she doesn't believe it will help.
    :(
    
    But she gave me the adress of a friend who might.
    
    The Scotland tripis planned.
    
    So all in all I hope to be much better in 2 or 3 weeks from now.
