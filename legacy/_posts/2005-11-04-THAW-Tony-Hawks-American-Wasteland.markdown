<h1>THAW - Tony Hawks American Wasteland</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    So I nearly finished thug2 (Tony Hawks Underground 2) and now I see this trailer for THAW.
    
    I want to have it.
    
    I played every Tony Hawks game.
    Starting from THPS (Tony Hawks Pro Skater) via THPS4 (Tony Hawks Pro Skater 4) to THUG (Tony Hawks Undergound) just finishing THUG2( Tony Hawks Underground2) now.
    
    I player the first 4 parts on my playstation (which I bought just for that reason).
    I bough a PS2 (and later a PStwo) just for THUG and THUG2.
    
    And now I want that THAW.
    
    Need it.
    
    I guess it's just a simple remake of the same old thing.
    But hey, that same old thing has been a lot of fun in the last 6 parts.
