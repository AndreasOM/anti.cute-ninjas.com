<h1>CPPS - 3 Month and Going - Summary</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    OK,
    I got quite a few questions from people who don't speak german about my struggles with my <em>disease</em>.
    Some of them where from friends, some from people who where looking for help and stumbled upon my blog.
    
    (F체r die nicht Englisch Sprechenden unter euch, werde ich demn채chst das ganze nochmal ins Deutsch 체bersetzen.
    Oder ihr lest einfach meine alten Blog Eintr채ge.)
    
    Sometime in early september this year a strange <em>itching</em> started to develop at the end of my penis.
    Since it got a little bit annoying, I visited my doctor.
    He did a few basic checks and when he felt my prostate gland it hurt like hell. 
    (Well, in hindesight it was only minor.)
    So he sent me to an Urologist.
    There we did serveral tests, but apart from that sensitivity to the touch,
    there was nothing.
    
    "Possibly a tripper, take some antibiotics and you'll be fine in a week." (<a href="http://anti.cute-ninjas.com/wp/archives/2004/09/">Blog entry</a>)
    Got Tavanic and Doxyciclin.
    He took some blood to run a test, to see what exactly it was.
    A day later I felt like shit.
    Major depression. Really bad stomach problems. (<a href="http://anti.cute-ninjas.com/wp/archives/2004/09/14/133/">Blog entry</a>)
    A week later I was back to my doc. The results showed nothing. So no need to finish the antibiotics. (<a href="http://anti.cute-ninjas.com/wp/archives/2004/09/20/138/">Blog entry</a>)
    
    10 days later I still felt like shit. (<a href="http://anti.cute-ninjas.com/wp/archives/2004/09/30/144/">Blog entry</a>)
    I had a CT that week, but that showed nothing. "You look perfectly healthy."
    
    About four weeks passed. They told me "you are healthy" and "it'll get better".
    And I felt worse and worse.
    After a second CT and a few Docs I finally had a diagnosis.
    "Abakterial prostatitis or CPPS". (<a href="http://anti.cute-ninjas.com/wp/archives/2004/10/18/149/">Blog entry</a>)
    At that time I didn't even know what that was.
    "But we have an experimental treatment. ESWT (Extracorporal ShockWave Therapie)".
    Basically getting shot at with "noise". They used this to destroy kidney and bladder stones for years and years.
    
    A week after that (after my first ESWT) I had some information on my problem.
    And I was totally devastated. (<a href="http://anti.cute-ninjas.com/wp/archives/2004/10/25/157/">Blog entry</a>)
    Had to go to the restroom about every 5-20 minutes.
    No sexual interest. And came after about 15 seconds of stimulation to my penis end.
    Got pretty week by then, with my legs giving away.
    Still stomach problems and aches in my left leg.
    
    A week later I visited a proctologist, to check my final intestine. (<a href="http://anti.cute-ninjas.com/wp/archives/2004/10/30/160/">Blog entry</a>)
    Nothing.
    By then the ache in my left leg, started to wander towars my nuts.
    My mood was very bad,
    but I decided to fight.
    
    Played with <strong>bengay</strong> for a while, since the area of my kidneys was always very cold.
    But things didn't improve.
    
    By the beginning of november things were sometimes a little better,
    but usually quite bad. (<a href="http://anti.cute-ninjas.com/wp/archives/2004/11/02/164/">Blog entry</a>)
    Walking usually killed me.
    One day I was on a trade show (a lot of walking)
    and the next I had to pee every 20 Minutes again.
    Started to look into alternative medicine.
    
    In the middle of september things got really bad. (<a href="http://anti.cute-ninjas.com/wp/archives/2004/11/10/166/">Blog entry</a>)
    I was going to my third ESWT. But broke down at the ambulance.
    Ended up staying in the hospital for a week.
    
    Did an intestine reflection and gastroscopy. 
    Nothing.
    
    The next ESWT didn't happen. The machine started leaking. (<a href="http://anti.cute-ninjas.com/wp/archives/2004/11/11/168/">Blog entry</a>)
    I read <a href="http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=webhome00d%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.de/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=097277551X%2526location=/o/ASIN/097277551X%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82" title="View product details at Amazon">A Headache in the Pelvis: A New Understanding and Treatment for Prostatitis and Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndromes</a> by Dr. David Wise.
    That gave me some hope.
    He basically says the the whole thing is <em>cramp</em>.
    The whole pelvic floor starts to contract, but doesn't let go.
    Since the muscles don't get supplies while contracted,
    they start to starve. When they starve they <em>feel</em> that something is wrong
    and start to react. They try to protect the body ... by ...
    ... <strong>contracting</strong> even more.
    So all I had to do was loosen that cramp ...
    
    A week later I still felt bad.
    I started with AT (again) and was pretty sure that I didn't have CPPS.
    The symptoms simply didn't match.
    
    A few days later I visited a Kinesiologist. (<a href="http://anti.cute-ninjas.com/wp/archives/2004/11/18/173/">Blog entry</a>)
    Was a bit like HokusPokus, but there were some parts that seemed to make sense.
    In the end he told me to avoid (cow)milk for a few weeks.
    
    A day later I ended up at another alternative <i>doctor</i>. (<a href="http://anti.cute-ninjas.com/wp/archives/2004/11/19/177/">Blog entry</a>)
    He is a friend of a very good friend.
    And I struck gold.
    He found some of the <i>triggerpoints</i> in my belly.
    He just pressed on them for a while --- that hurt like hell --- until the muscle went soft again.
    And that was really a good relief.
    He calls it "Myoreflex Therapie". In swiss it's called "Manual Triggerpoint Therapie"
    and Dr. Wise (USA) calls it "Myfascial Triggerpoint Therapie",
    but I guess it's all the same.
    
    After that session I felt so much better.
    I really thought that was the start of the end of the whole problem.
    
    The next week I went to a chinese doctor,
    intending to do accupuncture as pain relief. (<a href="http://anti.cute-ninjas.com/wp/archives/2004/11/25/178/">Blog entry</a>)
    Had the needles put in and it hurt like hell.
    After that I talke to another doctor and she told me:
    - No Milk (none at all)
    - No Sugar
    - No Nuts
    - No spices
    - No (uncooked) vegetables
    - Drink only warm water with honey
    For at least 3 to 6 month.
    
    My belly got worse after the first treatment,
    but I learned that that is expected and considered a good sign.
    
    Went on with accupuncture and myreflex therapie.
    I really thought that's it.
    
    Then one saturday I got this really bad kick in the crotch out of nowhere. (<a href="http://anti.cute-ninjas.com/wp/archives/2004/11/29/182/">Blog entry</a>)
    Took a hot bath and it seemed a little better.
    Well, started peeing blood the next day.
    So back to my urologist.
    
    Went on with accupuncture, myoreflex and went to an orthopedic doctor.
    He did some chiropractic on my back,
    but said that was only minor.
    
    By then I started asking myself, why my leg and stomach hurts
    if I have CPPS ? (<a href="http://anti.cute-ninjas.com/wp/archives/2004/12/06/186/">Blog entry</a>
    
    All the things finally seemed to get me in the right direction.
    Things really seemed to get better.
    
    Had a bladder reflection. (<a href="http://anti.cute-ninjas.com/wp/archives/2004/12/13/192/">Blog entry</a>
    Was no problem, since I was really relaxed.
    The whole bladder looked infected,
    so back to taking drugs again.
    No antibiotics!
    
    By mid december I had my last myreflex therpie for the year,
    since my therapeut went on vaction. (<a href="http://anti.cute-ninjas.com/wp/archives/2004/12/17/199/">Blog entry</a>)
    But I felt quite good.
    The next day I thought I was going to die.
    By monday I had the runs. Well, it was more like water what came out of my bowels.
    Luckily I found another therapist, that had an open slot that day. (<a href="http://anti.cute-ninjas.com/wp/archives/2004/12/22/201/">Blog entry</a>)
    She made my muscles soft again and suggested to got to the "tropical klinink" and visit another "doctor",
    specialised in food allergies.
    I phoned him up and had an appointment three days later.
    
    So I visited him. (<a href="http://anti.cute-ninjas.com/wp/archives/2004/12/23/202/">Blog entry</a>)
    He took some blood, so the lab can do a full immune profile,
    which will tell my if I have any food allergies or incompatibility.
    He also did a perturbative field analysis.
    The reslut ?
    - No Milk
    - No Sugar
    - No Proteins
    Oh my, I start running out of options.
    
    He also gave me some advice (and drugs) to help me get my intestine system back on track.
    
    Today it's christmas eve and I still don't know where this thing is going.
    All I need is that the "normal" doctors didn't help at all and only mad things worse.
    Alternative medicine at least helps a little.
    
    I'll keep you posted.
