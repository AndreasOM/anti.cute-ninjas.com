<h1>Earthquake</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Apparently we had an earthquake (3.0) about 5 miles from my home last night (around 03:50).
    
    I heard it on the radio, I was sleeping like a stone.
    
    Only thing I noticed was that one of my photos fell of the fridge ... but that might not be related.
