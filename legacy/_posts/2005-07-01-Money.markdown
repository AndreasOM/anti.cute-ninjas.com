<h1>Money</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Usually we get paid somewhere around the 28th.
    Usually!
    
    This month there where some "hiccups" in the process.
    So when do I get paid ?
    
    This month ?
    Nope.
    
    They'll fix it with the next month salary.
    
    I hope my landlord will understand...
    
    And I hope somebody will throw some food in my direction.
