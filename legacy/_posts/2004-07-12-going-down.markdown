<h1>going down</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Imagine the following.
    
    ---
    You are on a big cruise ship.
    Everyone is happy to go to the golden land.
    
    You get the feeling that something really bad is going to happen.
    You try to warn the others.
    But nobody listens.
    
    You start searching for a way to escape.
    Finally you find a tiny escape pod.
    
    You leave.
    You paddle as hard as you can to get away from the ship.
    
    The ship is starting to sink.
    You keep paddling.
    
    The ship goes down.
    Creating tidal waves.
    You manage to paddle away.
    
    But the ship sucks you down with it.
    You keep swiming to the surface.
    
    You are almost exhausted.
    You manage to get to the top.
    
    You take a breath of fresh air.
    
    
    Then a big hand grabs you from below
    and pulls you down.
    
    You hear their voices:
    "We are almost there ... we can already the the beaches of the golden land."
    
    You feel the air leaving your lunges,
    being replaced by water...

    That's how I feel right now...
