<h1>10 Things I hate about my iPod</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I bought my 4GB iPod Mini about 6 month ago and here are various things I hate about it.
    
    <ol>
    \t<li>
    The price.
    Value for money is simply off the scale. You can get a player with similar features for half the money.
            </li>
    
    \t<li>
    The headphones.
    They are white... yuck.
    They are to big for my ears ... so they hurt after a while.
    They sound horrible. They have a lot of power in the bass, but the heights are barely audible. This is ok for modern Techno/Drum'n'Base, but not for the music I listen to.
    </li>
    
    \t<li>
    The clickwheel.
    It doesn't work if temperatures are below 10C/50F (Read: winter).
    It doesn't work above 30C/86F (Read: summer).
    Sometimes it just doesn't work at all.
    </li>
    
    \t<li>
    Playlists handling I - Navigation
    The "three clicks to every song"-myth. I have about 400 different artists on my iPod, so when I want to listen to Madonna,
    I have to CLICK (1) Menu, CLICK (2) Music, SCROLL (1) Artists, SCROLL (240), CLICK(3) Madonna, CLICK (4) All, CLICK(5) "Song".
    Even if I count each revolution with the clickwheel as only on click, I still end up at around 20 "CLICKS".
    My car radio (empeg MKII) has a user-definable playlist structure, including hierachical playlists. That makes it so much easier. With over 800 Artists I need only 8 "CLICKS" ... worst case!
    </li>
    
    \t<li>
    Playlist handling II - Podcasts
    Maybe I'm too stupid, but...
    When I want to listen to a podcast in my car all I do is to go to the podcasts menu entry/playlist and click play
    and it simply plays the oldest not fully played song/item and starts at the last position I listened to.
    With my iPod I have to remember where I left of.
    </li>
    
    \t<li>
    Reencoding.
    Why oh why?
    When I load music from  iTunes onto my iPod, I want to reencode them to 128Kb/s MP3.
    The 320Kbs is simply to big and not noticable with the poor headphones anyway,
    but stupid iTunes won't let me do this :(
    You can only reencode to AAC ... and that's neither what I want, nor what I need.
    </li>
    
    \t<li>
    Portability.
    Why do I have to decide if I want to use my iPod from MACOS or Windows ?
    I got a Mac at home and one at work, but when I'm on the road there are only windows systems.
    So what now ?
    Stupid.
    My car-radio works with macos, windows, linux ... and everything else. At the same time!
    </li>
    
    \t<li>
    The off switch.
    The what ?
    Exactly. Where is the freakin' off switch ?
    Everytime I get out off an airplane an pull out my iPod I find the batteries empty, because someone/something touched the button and it was playing the whole time.
    Add an hardware switch and that problem is gone!
    </li>
    
    \t<li>
    Firewire
    Need I say more ?
    </li>
    
    \t<li>
    Last, but not least:
    The display.
    Too much (useless/uneeded) information, while the important info (e.g. title and artist) is written in 5 point font.
    I have really good eyesight, so I can read it from a foot away, but other displays - with the same size - are readable from 10 feet away.
    </li>
    
    </ol>
    
    Would I buy one again ?
    I guess not...
