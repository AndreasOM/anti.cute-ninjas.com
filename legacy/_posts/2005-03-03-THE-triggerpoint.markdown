<h1>THE triggerpoint</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Just had my fourth session with Bill.
    
    Looks like we found the core of the problem.
    There is a really (really REALLY) bad triggerpoint on my left levator ani (the Coccygeus to be exact).
    By pressing on the triggerpoint he could refer pain to all the parts of my body I had problems with over the last month;
    And -  maybe more importantly - he caused the itching (which was the first problem that I had) to get really bad.
    
    I made 4 other appointments and will be back in Edinburgh in early April and early May.
    
    This might really be the solution :)
