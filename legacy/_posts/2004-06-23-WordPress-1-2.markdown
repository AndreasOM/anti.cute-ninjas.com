<h1>WordPress 1.2</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/archives/2004/05/22/heres-the-beef/">WordPress 1.2</a> has just been released.
    
    I'll try to upgrade soon...
