Downgraded the chrooted system on blue2 (aka purple) to binutils 2.9.5.0.37-1 (the version from stable)
to be able to compile 2.4.18pre7.

Will install grub now to be able to boot into the new system.
And then we'll see what breaks.

(I installed blue2 (aka purple aka red) over 6 years ago and it grew from there,
so I'm not quite sure what is needed.)
