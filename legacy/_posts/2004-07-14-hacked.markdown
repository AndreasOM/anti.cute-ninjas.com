(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Argl. Stupid me.
    
    Here is what I could reconstruct:
    
    1. I had OpenSSH 3.7 running.
    2. I had iptables set up to only allow connections from certain hosts.
    3. I used my DSL to connect to the internet.
    
    4. I upgraded my kernel to 2.6.7 last week.
    5. I forgot to enable the iptables module
    
    6. Intruder used ssh exploit to gain access.
    
    7. Intruder abused my system as an xmule/edonkey relay with a high speed connection.
    
    I would have never noticed if not our "site security" had noticed the strange behaviour of my system.
    (Loads and loads of TCP SYN)
    
    
    I might get into real trouble this time :(
