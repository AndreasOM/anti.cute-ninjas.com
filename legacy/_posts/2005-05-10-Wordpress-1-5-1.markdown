<h1>Wordpress 1.5.1</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    The guys are simply to fast for me:
    <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2005/05/one-five-one/">Wordpress 1.5.1</a>
    
    The security update and the improved SQL queries alone should make this upgrade worth the effort.
    I hope the upgrade is quicker than the last one.
    I have to upgrade over a dozen blogs...
