(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I just ordered mine yesterday.
    
    It was just to hard to resist.
    I've been waiting for a sub $500 Mac for a few years now.
    The Mac Mini is slightly above that, but who cares ;)
    
    Should be here in two weeks...
