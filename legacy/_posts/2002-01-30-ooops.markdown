forgot to dump the database on the old system.

chroot is your friend ;)

New system up and running.

DSL working.

dyndns updater working.

Apache OK.

mysql OK.

squid OK.

bind OK.

At least nobody will really notice the difference.

since my dynamic IP is listed at mail-abuse.org and sourceforge is using that blacklist :(
