<h1>ooops</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    forgot to dump the database on the old system.<br />
    chroot is your friend ;)<br />
    <br />
    New system up and running.<br />
    DSL working.<br />
    dyndns updater working.<br />
    Apache OK.<br />
    mysql OK.<br />
    squid OK.<br />
    bind OK.<br />
    <br />
    Hey it's almost back to 100%.<br />
    At least nobody will really notice the difference.<br />
    <br />
    I still have to fix exim (or maybe postfix),<br />
    since my dynamic IP is listed at mail-abuse.org and sourceforge is using that blacklist :(<br />
