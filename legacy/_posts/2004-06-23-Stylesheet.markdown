<h1>Stylesheet</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Since I don't have time to fixup the layout ... again,
    but the original WP .css looks ... hmmm ... not really great.
    
    I just snatched one from here:
