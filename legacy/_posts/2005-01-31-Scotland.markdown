<h1>Scotland</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Had my second treatment last thursday.
    It was painfull, but it helped.
    
    Had a long trip back home. My flight was delayed about 4 hours,
    so I ended up arriving at home around 6am.
    
    Slept most of the day on friday.
    On saturday did some shopping with Kathrin and still felt great, despite the cold.
    Had dinner with friends and even went out clubbing.
    
    I still felt great sunday morning.
    Sunday afternoon the 'itching' came back full blown
    and shortly after that my belly was hurting again.
    It felt like concrete.
    
    Today I had weak legs again.
    
    Will go back to scotland soon.
