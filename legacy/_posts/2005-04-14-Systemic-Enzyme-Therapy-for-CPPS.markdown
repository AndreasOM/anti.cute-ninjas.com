<h1>Systemic Enzyme Therapy for CPPS</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    There are some rumors floating around that Systemic Enzyme Therapy (SET) is helpfull in curing CPPS.
    I didn't find any hard evidence yet,
    but from what I understood so far about it (=Systemic Enzyme Therapy) it should be the right direction.
    
    a) SET has an analgesic effect
    b) the effect of all other drugs is enhanced, thus you need to take less
    c) the (myofascial) triggerpoint release/therapy should be far less painfull
    
    I'll do some more research and might even start with a little experiment (on myself).
