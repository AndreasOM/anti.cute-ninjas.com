<h1>Xbox 360</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Please!
    
    Stop it.
    
    Everywhere you look you see folks telling you:
    "The Xbox 360 is the first console of the next generation!"
    
    I had the "honour" playing with one for the last few days ... and ...
    Well ... that's what I'm waiting for. There is no "and".
    It's just another xbox.
    
    OK, it is a little bit faster and it has better graphics,
    but that's what you get if you buy a new PC every year.
    
    There is no revolution with the 360.
    It's only evolution.
    And only very little steps forward.
    
    Here is what I am saying:
    "The Xbox 360 is the last console of the last generation!"
    
    Don't believe me ?
    
    We'll talk again next thanksgiving ;)
