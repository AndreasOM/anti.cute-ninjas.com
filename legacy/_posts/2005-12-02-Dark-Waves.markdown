(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I didn't feel to good yesterday, so I missed the show,
    but this is what I had planned to play:
    
    <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=D*yUd399k/o&offerid=99176.

    how?id=D*yUd399k/o&bids=99176.467745537&type=10&subid="/>
    
    Wrong date ?
    
    Nope, that's the next show ... and then I will play it.
    
    Just a little sneak peek into the playlist:
