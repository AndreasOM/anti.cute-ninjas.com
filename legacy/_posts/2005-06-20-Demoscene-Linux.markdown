<h1>Demoscene - Linux</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    After this years breakpoint we had some very hot discussions with the organizers about linux entries and the demoscene in general.
    <a href="http://www.hboeck.de/item/100">Hanno</a> (aka the "ueluelue" guy), who wasn't involved in this, has written a nice (and short) article about this for hugi.
    
    I ported a few OpenGL Windows Intros to linux (mainly Cubalid 7 stuff) and it usually wasn't a big problem.
    The "installing an additional OS on the compo PC"-reason was what pissed me off the most and hanno hits that nail right on the head
    with his "just use gentoo games" response. Which I had already mentioned before the party, but nobody would listen...
