<h1>PortaGame.com - Photo Contest: Win A GBA Movie Player</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I don't have an entry (or even an idea for an entry) yet:
    <a href="http://www.portagame.com/index.php/2004/09/23/gba_movie_player_contest">PortaGame.com - Photo Contest: Win A GBA Movie Player</a>
    
    But I just triggered the whole german scene ;)
