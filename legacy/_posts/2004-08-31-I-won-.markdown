<h1>I won.</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Just got a phone call.
    
    I won some lottery game (that I can't remember ever having played).
    Well, I didn't win anything real.
    I just won a "free" ticket for a lottery.
    
    No catch. (i asked ... twice).
    
    All they wanted to now was my bank account info.
    Via the phone.
    
    Hello. Anybody home ?
    
    So maybe I lost the opportunity to win another million.
    But maybe I saved myself from getting my money stolen from my account.
    
    Call me paranoid, but I develop(ed) the software that runs the transactions ...
