<h1>Auto Hypnosis</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Last week I started with hypnosis (DRTRC) to help myself relax even better.
    
    Did three sessions so far. Two saturday and one today.
    
    I always "fall asleep" at the same time, so I guess it's working.
    It's just creating a simply trigger to relax ... nothing more.
    
    In a few weeks I should be able to tell you how good it is working.
