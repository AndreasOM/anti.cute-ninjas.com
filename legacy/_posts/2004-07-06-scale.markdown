<h1>scale</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    No workout today,
    but I got myself one of those modern scales, that measure body fat and water percentage.
    
    I don't consider these absolute,
    but as a relative measurement of tendency it should be fine.
    
    Right now:
    76.2kg
    16.8% fat
    60.7% water
    
    Water is a little bit low. Fat is good, but still could be a little better.
    Let's aim for 15%,
    while holding my weight.
    
    [edit]
    Funny.
    I wanted to get "better/cleaner" results and remeasured without clothes:
    77.0kg
    17.7% fat
    60% water
