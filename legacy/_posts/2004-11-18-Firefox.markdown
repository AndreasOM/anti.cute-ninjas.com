<h1>Firefox</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Don't forget:
    <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=affiliates&amp;id=25540&amp;t=77"><img border="0" alt="Get Firefox!" title="Get Firefox!" src="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/community/images/affiliates/Buttons/120x60/blank.gif"/></a>
    
    There is only one browser ... doing it right.
