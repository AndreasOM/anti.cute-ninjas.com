<h1>New Windows Virus.</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I just did an:<br />
    cat /var/log/apache/access.log | grep cmd.exe | wc -l<br />
    on PURPLE.<br />
    the result ?<br />
    <br />
    6019<br />
    <br />
    Yes. These Windos loosers start to annoy me.<br />
    I always said everybody should use what he likes.<br />
    <br />
    It's time to fight back ...<br />
    cat /var/log/apache/access.log* | grep cmd.exe | cut -f1 -d" " | xargs -n 1 nuke<br />
    <br />
    Sorry, if you just inherited a dialup IP, but if this works you're in trouble anyway...<br />
