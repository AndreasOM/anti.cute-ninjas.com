<h1>wordpress theme bug</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I finally found the bug in my theme, that put the sidebar right over the content on the single pages.
    
    comments.php was including sidebar.php at the wrong place.
    I moved it to single.php and now everything looks ok.
