<h1>Writing my own eBook</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I just bought an ebook about
    <a href="/links/7dayebook.php">Writing an eBook in 7 days</a>.
    Once I'm through I'm gonna write my own ebook.
    
    Good plan ?
    
    Don't know yet.
    I'll keep ya posted...
    
    Too bad that clickbank doesn't have a usable backdoor :(
    
    Only joking...
    
    And I just created a new category >><a href="http://anti.cute-ninjas.com/news/archives/category/projects/7dayebook/">7dayebook</a><< to keep you posted.
