(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I always wanted something like this:
    <a href="http://www.popgadget.net/2004/10/calory-answer-spectroscopic.html">Popgadget: Personal Tech for Women: Calory Answer Spectroscopic Calorimeter</a>
    
    But I might have to wait a while, till the price drops...
