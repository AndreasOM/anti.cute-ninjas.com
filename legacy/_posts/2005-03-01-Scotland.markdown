(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I had my third treatment today.
    Three hours of torture, but I think it was worth it.
    
    Bill said it's about 40% better compared to the first treatment.
    (I was thinking 30%, but I guess he is right.)
    
    He's getting down to deeper layers now and seems to be pretty confident
    that he is doing the right thing.
    
    Well, I'll wait and see.
    
    Next treatment is on thursday.
