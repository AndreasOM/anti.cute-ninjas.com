<h1>Today</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Spent the day at a local internet cafe.
    Don't feel really bad, but don't feel that good either.
    I guess walking around town all day yesterday didn't help improve my state
    and left me a bit exhausted.
    
    Sitting in the hostel right now.
    Just wasting time.
    
    Will have one more session with Bill tomorrow,
    before I go back home.
