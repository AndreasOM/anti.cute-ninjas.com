<h1>New (internal) interface</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Just hacked a small interface to submit news via a webbrowser.
    <br />
    Now I should be able to update from (amlost) anywhere.
