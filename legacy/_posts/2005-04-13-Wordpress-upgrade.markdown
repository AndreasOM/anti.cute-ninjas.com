<h1>Wordpress upgrade</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Looks like the upgrade to 1.5 went smooth. Very smooth in fact.
    Only thing missing is the template/theme/style and some of the plugins.
    
    The URL has slightly changed, but I'll add forwarding from the old site in a while.
    (i.e. when things have settled down)
