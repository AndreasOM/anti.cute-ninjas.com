<h1>Kernel 2.6.8 - Framebuffer</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Last weekend I tried to update to 2.6.8 (from 2.6.7),
    but the vesa fb driver seems to be broken.
    
    1. I get a message about vga=834 being invalid (that should be 1400x1250@16bpp, which I have been using for quite a while now)
    2. The screen totally gets scambled under the console. I can startx after booting blind and it is working, but that is very unsatisfactory.
    
    Will stick with 2.6.7 and wait for 2.6.9 :(
