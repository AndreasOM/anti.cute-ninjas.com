(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    People everywhere are complaining that the Mac Mini would make the perfect "set top box" or "home media center"
    if it only had a video/tv capture card.
    
    I just don't get it.
    
    You got this really cute video playing device and a broadband connection.
    When will you actually watch TV ?
    
    Just download the stuff (legally) from the web. <em>iMovies</em> anyone ?
    
    Oh, you want to capture your selfmade videos ?
    Hmmm ... put one end of a FireWire cable into your cam and the other into the Mac Mini.
    Any problem ?
    
    Stop complaining.
    
    The only thing really missing for this thing is a big harddisk...
    ... wait a minute. That's connected to the WiFi-Broadband-DSL-Router-Printer-Server anyway.
    
    Now I only need a cute little (bluetooth) iRemote.
