<h1>Status</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I've been on vacation for the last two weeks,
    so I haven't always been close to my computer.
    
    I had a pretty good week following x-mas.
    Still aching, but no (major) pain.
    
    Last week I visited the local "tropical hospital".
    They took some samples and if they find anything I'll know it in about 6 weeks.
    
    On new years day it started to get bad again,
    but I had a Myoreflex Therapie on tuesday... and that helped.
    
    I visited my family on thursday and saw a Doctor in DÃ¼sseldorf.
    After I told him which medication I got
    he told me that I had to have digestion problems.
    He prescribed some medicine to help get my stomach and intestines back on track.
    
    At the end he asked if I ever was checked for a yeast infection and I gave him the test results
    from my (ex-)doctor. He looked at it and told me that I hd a very high number in the yeast test.
    So much for "everything alright".
    He got some samples and will have an additional test done.
    Might take a week or two...
    
    Got an appointment with a physiotherapist ... in scotland...
    I've been told he can help.
    
    Will be back to work next week, so you'll get more updates again.
