(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Now that the first boxes are out in the wild, I can finaly say what I think about this ...
    
    - It's to noisy. Is it me ? Or does it sound like a hurricane ?
    - The power brick. Well, want to kill someone ? Need a weapon ?
    - The games ? I'm totally unimpressed. Luckily I don't have to buy one.
    
    Still holding my breath - and saving my money - for the Playstation 3.
    
    Just check some <a href="http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/xbox-360/xbox-360-in-the-house-for-reals-137284.php">screenshots</a>
