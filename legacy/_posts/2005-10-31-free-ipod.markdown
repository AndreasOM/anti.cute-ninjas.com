<h1>free ipod</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I usually don't like the "do this and get a free that"-schemes,
    but this one actually seems to work.
    
    At least I have a few friends, that got their free ipod.
    And I really want the new 30 gig video version.
    
    
    So please gimme a hand:
    <a href="http://ipods.freepay.com/?r=24500449">Get a free iPod</a> ... and help me get one, too.
