<h1>iBook G4</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    For the last few weeks I've been looking for a notebook.
    It wasn't that easy.
    I had some requirements, but couldn't find anything that fullfilled them.
    
    I almost decided to buy the MacBook, even though the GPU sucks big time,
    when I took one last look into the refurbished store and found the little beauty I'm currently typing on.
    
    A sleek white iBook G4 (1.33 GHz, 512MB RAM, Radeon 9550 32MB).
    
    I love it.
