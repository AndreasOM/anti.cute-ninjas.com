<h1>Chakra Therapy</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Just had another "chakra" session.
    At the beginning it went very smooth.
    I started to wonder if anything will happen at all,
    but then she went to work on my "bad side" (=left) again
    and the pain was there. Full blown.
    
    She told me that the bands and muscles on that side seem to be very short and tight.
    That's confirming what the therapist in scotland said.
    
    She told me to get a red shawl. To help my mood get better.
    Ever since that whole thing started I waited for someone to blame it on my black outfit.
    Now it happened ... and I believe her ... ;)
    Well, will wear more of my red stuff from now on.
    Luckily I got plenty.
