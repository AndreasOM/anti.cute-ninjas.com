<h1>speeding up</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Ahhh ... I'm slowly getting up to speed again.
    
    Been cleaning out a lot of old stuff.
    
    Almost finished my bathroom yesterday.
    Added a toplist to oneof my forums (<a href="http://www.schwarzes-forum.de/toplist/">Schwarzes-Forum [german]</a>), hopefully this will drive the traffic a little bit more.
    Recored my first podcast ... still needs some editing.
    Finally set up the imap server for our mailserver.
    Started rewritting the fake-lib build with scons. So pretty soon there should be a new <a href="http://stoned.cute-ninjas.com/">stoned</a> release.
    
    Lots of small stuff,
    but I'm going again and that's what is counting.
