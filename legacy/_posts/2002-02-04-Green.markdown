<h1>Green</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Connected Green again.<br />
    Installed the newest nvidia drivers. (Green has a TNT2 M64).<br />
    They are fast like hell :)<br />
    But the system freezes after 60 seconds :(<br />
    <br />
    hmmm ... I should have fixed my Voodoo instead of buying this nvidia crap.<br />
