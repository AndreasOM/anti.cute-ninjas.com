<h1>Stanford</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    As I already mentioned before I'll be going to San Francisco next week.
    To get treatment according to the "Stanford Protocol".
    So it's time to check my status to see how much improvement the trip brings.
    
    After my last visit to scotland in the second week of may I felt pretty good.
    I went to a four day open air festival (sleeping in a tent, in the cold, with rain all weekend) and survived with only one very minor (2 minute) flare up.
    
    Since then I had a pretty good time.
    I had a small flare up last week.
    And a bigger one this week ... the last few days weren't so good.
    But overall I feel pretty fine :)
    
    I haven't been doing my relaxation exercises lately nor my stretches.
    I've been pushing my diet to the limits and it's still OK.
    
    I hope that after my trip I'll be 100% OK again.
