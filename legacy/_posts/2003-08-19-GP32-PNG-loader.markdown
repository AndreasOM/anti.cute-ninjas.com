<h1>GP32 - PNG loader</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    This morning I had a big mouth,
    <br />
    about being able to write a (simplistic) PNG loader
    <br />
    that is working on the GP32.
    <br />
    
    <br />
    Now (5 hours later, including 20 minutes coding) I did it :)
    <br />
    
    <br />
    It's not perfect.
    <br />
    No...
    <br />
    ...interlaced images.
    <br />
    ...filtered images.
    <br />
    ...non indexed images.
    <br />
    
    <br />
    But more than enough for demos and games.
    <br />
    
    <br />
