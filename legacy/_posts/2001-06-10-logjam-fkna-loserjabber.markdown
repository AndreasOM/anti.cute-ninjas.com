<h1>logjam fkna loserjabber</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Last week - while I was ... offline - Evan renamed loserjabber to logjam and released a new (IMHO much better) version.<br />
    <br />
    Now I only have to make this work with my own server.<br />
    Or simply user the old loserjabber for my servers and logjam for livejournal;<br />
    That would also solve my multiple config file problem.<br />
    <br />
