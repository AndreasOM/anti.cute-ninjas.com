<h1>Symptoms</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I didn't find the time to work with the self hypnosis,
    but I worked on my triggerpoints.
    
    Yesterday I found a really bad one ... and today it's already much better.
    
    This stuff should be taught at school.
