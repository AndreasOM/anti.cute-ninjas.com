<h1>Black Discard - Lost</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Argl.
    
    I played my black megrim discard deck yesterday ... and lost.
    
    First match was 2-1.
    I lost the first after my openent imprinted a boomerang on his artifact and kept me going with one mana :(
    No annul in this deck ...
    
    Second match was 2-0.
    
    Simple beatdown deck ... I was mana screwed both games :(
    
    Maybe I should stop playing magic...
    
    At least I got 9 points now overall.
    So I got a pretty land.
    I choose a swamp.
    
    Am building a ravnica peasant magic deck ... won't tell you before next monday though.
