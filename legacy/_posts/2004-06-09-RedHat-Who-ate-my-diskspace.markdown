<h1>RedHat - Who ate my diskspace</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I installed a "tiny" RedHat into VMWare yesterday.
    I gave it a 4GB disk, since that would be easy to backup on a single DVD.
    
    Today I tried to build our SDK and the disk was full.
    
    So who is using up all the space ?
    <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/rpmsize/">rpmsize and rpmhog</a> are the needed helpers.
