(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Just found this "service" and gonna give it a try:
    <a href="http://wholinkstome.com/" title="Click here to see who's linking to this site.  Powered by WhoLinksToMe.com.">Who Links Here</a>
    
    If it doesn't work ... it'll be gone faster that you can read this entry...
