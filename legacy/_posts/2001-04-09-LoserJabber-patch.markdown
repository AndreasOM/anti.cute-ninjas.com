<h1>LoserJabber patch</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    This should be a cleaner solution to post to a different server.<br />
    <a href="http://webhome.nu/anti/patches/lj2.1.5-alternative_server.patch">PATCH</a> against LoserJabber 2.1.5.<br />
    <br />
    Next usefull thing could be an "use this config file"-option.<br />
