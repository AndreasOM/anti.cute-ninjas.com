it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Have been playing with one of my just for fun projects.
    A <a href="http://www.schwarzes-forum.de/">Gothic Forum</a>.
    
    I wonder how long until google picks it up ?
    
    Only one indexed page so far ?
    <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&q=allinurl%3Aschwarzes-forum.de+site%3Awww.schwarzes-forum.de&btnG=Search">Check</a>
