<h1>Moving</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Just switched to a new server. (Cheaper and more reliable.)
    
    Almost all domains are moved.
    
    This is just a short reminder to myself which sites still need to be moved:
    
    stoned.cute-ninjas.com <font color="red">[2005-01-12] Moved.</font>
    stoned.webhome.de <font color="red">[2005-01-12] Moved.</font>
    football-forum.de <font color="red">[2005-01-12] Moved.</font>
    cute-ninjas.com <font color="red">[2005-01-12] Moved.</font>
    webhome.de <font color="red">[2005-01-19] Moved.</font>
    
    webhome.nu  <font color="red">[2005-01-19] Moving...</font>
    
    desaintpaul.de (including all subdomains)
    
    Moved but needs fixing:
    biker-forum.com (move database) <font color="red">[2005-01-12] Database moved.</font>
    
    Other stuff needed:
    Move CVS.
    Move SVN.
    Move /home
    
    <div class="edit">
    Will add fixes in <font color="red">red</font>.
    </div>
