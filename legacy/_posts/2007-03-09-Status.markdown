Just a quick note on what I've been doing.

In preperation for the upcoming work on [Stoned 2.0](http://stoned.omni-mad.com/), I created a new (wordpress based) [website](http://stoned.omni-mad.com/) and copied most of the stuff from the [old stoned site](http://stoned.cute-ninjas.com/).
It's not perfect, but it's a start.

I started to implement the POS (Point of Sale) System for Kathrin's Shop ([Elfenrausch](http://www.elfenrausch.de/)).
Just some simple PHP and MySQL based stuff.
It will run on her [MacMini](http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000AOHZPY/webhome00d/)
with [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/)
Right now I'm looking for a good kiosk mode solution.
Firefox sucks ... in this regard,
so it looks like I'm going the [camino](http://www.caminobrowser.org/)
There is a kiosk-extension, but I couldn't find a way to force camino into kiosk mode at startup,
so right now I'm downloading the newest XCode installer, to build camino from scratch;
And add the missing features.
(Fullscreen/Kiosk-mode that still allows user switching.)
