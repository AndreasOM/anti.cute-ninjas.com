<h1>Status</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Just a quick note on what I've been doing.
    
    In preperation for the upcoming work on <a href="http://stoned.omni-mad.com/">Stoned 2.0</a>, I created a new (wordpress based) <a href="http://stoned.omni-mad.com/">website</a> and copied most of the stuff from the <a href="http://stoned.cute-ninjas.com/">old stoned site</a>.
    It's not perfect, but it's a start.
    
    I started to implement the POS (Point of Sale) System for Kathrin's Shop (<a href="http://www.elfenrausch.de/">Elfenrausch</a>).
    Just some simple PHP and MySQL based stuff.
    It will run on her <a href="http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000AOHZPY/webhome00d/">MacMini</a>
    with <a href="http://www.mamp.info/">MAMP</a>.
    Right now I'm looking for a good kiosk mode solution.
    Firefox sucks ... in this regard,
    so it looks like I'm going the <a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/">camino</a> road.
    There is a kiosk-extension, but I couldn't find a way to force camino into kiosk mode at startup,
    so right now I'm downloading the newest XCode installer, to build camino from scratch;
    And add the missing features.
    (Fullscreen/Kiosk-mode that still allows user switching.)
