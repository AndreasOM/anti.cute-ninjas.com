<h1>feh 1.2.6 - screen lock II</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Just fiddled with the screen lock patch.
    Now it uses the system password,
    but needs to be setuid root if shadow passwords are enabled.
    
    Would be glad if someone could do a little sanity check:
