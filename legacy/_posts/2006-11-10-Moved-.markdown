Long time no update, I know.

A few weeks ago our old provider (alturo) decided to piss everyone off and close its business.
Got a pretty nice deal for a new server by haggling ... a lot.

Only tradeoff:

The new system runs plesk.

And plesk is the pest.

On the old server everything was in one database and all the configuration files (bind, apache, mysql, postfix) were created by one simple script.

The layout was something like this:

    Customer
      ( 1 -> N  ) Login
      ( 1 -> N ) Sites

So if Customer "Thomas Test" had login "ttalpha" and "ttprod" with three domains (alpha.1.org, alpha.2.org + a.3.org and www.1.org, www.2.org + www.3.org),
then the filesystem looked like this:
    /home/
    --ttalpha/
    ----web/
    ------alpha.1.org/
    ------alpha.2.org/
    ------alpha.3.org/
    --ttprod/
    ----web/
    ------www.1.org/
    ------www.2.org/
    ------www.3.org/

With one login (and password/sshkey) shared per login/user,
but a tight seperation of the test and production sites.

Now with PLESK ... argl.

For the above setup, I need about 400 Clicks in the Webinterface.

And then I end up with 3 users ... and have the subdomains (alpha+www) shared for each domain.

Or I get 6 users ... with 6 logins and 6 passwords.

Yuck.

I still have to get qmail to work right. Some of my mail is simply swalloed and I have yet to find out what happens ... I don't even get bounces :(


This PLESK-mess sucks.

And I _will_ find a new host soon!

The DNS-disaster is a whole new story ...
