(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Red Hat Certified Architect
    
    <a href="https://www.redhat.com/training/architect/courses/">Curriculum</a>
    
    I did my RHCE(ngineer) last year.
    This looks like something to go for.
    
    I really don't use RedHat that much ... well, not at all.
    I'm using gentoo and debian,
    but it's always good to see what the others are up to.
    
    And RHCE is on of the most wanted/best paid certifications by employers...
