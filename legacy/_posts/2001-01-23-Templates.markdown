<h1>Templates</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    More work done.<br />
    <br />
    It's almost there.<br />
    <br />
    I think I have to go over the templates again to speed up the generated HTML.<br />
    (Less tables, more info for the renderer, etc.)<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    BTW:<br />
    I use <a href="http://www.engelschall.com/sw/wml/">WML</a> to generate these pages.
