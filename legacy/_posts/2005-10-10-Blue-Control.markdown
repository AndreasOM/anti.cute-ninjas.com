<h1>Blue Control</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    The new arena round is starting today (in about half an hour).
    
    I build a nice blue control deck.
    
    Either somebody is gonna hate me later ... or I'm gonna get totally burned.
    
    2 x Annul
    4 x Unsommon
    4 x Boomerang
    4 x Steel Wall
    4 x Eye of Nowhere
    4 x Memory Lapse
    4 x Cobalt Golem
    1 x Sea Monster
    4 x Yotian Soldier
    4 x Remove Soul
    1 x Graxiplon

    Plan is to keep the opponent down with the counters and then beat 'em up with the biggies.
    
    I'll let you know later how it went.
