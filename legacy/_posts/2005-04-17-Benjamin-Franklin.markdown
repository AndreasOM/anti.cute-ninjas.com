<h1>Benjamin Franklin</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    One of the great geniuses ... died today.
    215 years ago.
    
    He was born Jan. 17th 1706 and died Apirl 17th 1790.
    
    Just thought I mention it, since he was such a smart guy.
    
    Earl King (died 2003)
    and
    Linda Eastman McCartney (died 1998)
    were great people too, but Ben Franklin was special.
    
    While we are at it,
    today would be
    Krushchev's (*1984) and Wilders(1897) birthdays.
    
    I don't care if you wanted to know that ...
