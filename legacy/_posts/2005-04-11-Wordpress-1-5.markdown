<h1>Wordpress 1.5</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I switched some/most of my others sites to Wordpress 1.5 already.
    This one is next.
    
    1.5 is really that much better.
    
    Only thing left to do is to write the theme/style and I don't have the nerve to hack up CSS right now ;)
