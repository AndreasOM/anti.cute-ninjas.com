<h1>Gadget: Minimate</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    The <a href="http://htmini.com/2005/04/22/micronets-minimate-kicks-all-sorts-of-behind/">Minimate</a> is the thing I really need for my mini.
    I went for the "big" model with the 80GB harddisk, but it's nearly full and I'm only halfway through (re)ripping my CD collection.
