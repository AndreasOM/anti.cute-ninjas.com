<h1>Mera Luna</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Went to the Mera Luna Festival last weekend.
    
    Had a great time.
    Too much sunshine, but it's still better than rain.
    
    The organization was slightly better than last year, but still far from good.
    
    Shower and toilets wer clean and comfortable,
    but the quantity was a bit low.
    Imagine 25.000 people and 50 showers...
    
    The band lineup was good, but some bands didn't get enough time compared to others.
    Chamber got 30 minutes, while Blutengel got 70 minutes.
    (Hey, if I want to see Pop, I go to the dome...)
