<h1>NLP in 21 days</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Ouch.
    
    A few weeks ago I ordered a birthdaypresent (Die Aerzte - Devil) at amazon.
    I also added some books from my wishlist, to get the free shipping.
    
    All of the arrived within two days.
    Only one was late.
    
    This week I was in Edinburgh for my monthly treatment.
    
    While there I went into the local Waterstones and bought a few books
    (<a href="http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345430786/webhome00d/">Space</a> by Stephen Baxter and "<a href="http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/0749920300/webhome00d/">NLP in 21 days</a>").
    
    When I came back I had a parcel from amazon on my desk.
    I opened it up and ... guess what.
    
    It was "<a href="http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/0749920300/webhome00d/">NLP in 21 days</a>".
    
    Argl.
    
    I should start making lists ....
