<h1>Me, Myself and I</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Just googeled for myself and stumbled over a lot of interesting stuff that I once participated in:
    Here's a brief list ... in no particular order:
    <a href="http://sourceware.org/newlib/">Newlib</a>:
    Die the original CellBE SPU/SPE patch.
    
    <a href="http://www.twolame.org/">TwoLame</a>:
    Added a switch to change verbosity.
    
    <a href="http://www.transcoding.org/cgi-bin/transcode">Transcode</a>:
    Wrote the plugin for twolame, since it encoded mp2 much faster then mp2enc.
    
    <a href="http://www.scintilla.org/">SciTE</a>:
    Made file dialog size configurable and keep their state.
    Using a 400px wide dialog to select a file where character 250 differs is bad.
    Especially if you work on a 3200x1200 dual head setting.
    
    RedBook:
    
    [argl] ... time to upgrade my wordpress... just lost 70% of this post.
    Don't know which key I hit, but it was bad :(
