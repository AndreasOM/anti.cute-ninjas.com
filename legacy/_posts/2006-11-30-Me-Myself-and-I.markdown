title: "Me, Myself and I"

Just googeled for myself and stumbled over a lot of interesting stuff that I once participated in:

Here's a brief list ... in no particular order:

[Newlib](http://sourceware.org/newlib/):
Did the original CellBE SPU/SPE patch.

[TwoLame](http://www.twolame.org/):
Added a switch to change verbosity.

[Transcode](http://www.transcoding.org/cgi-bin/transcode):
Wrote the plugin for twolame, since it encoded mp2 much faster then mp2enc.

[SciTE](http://www.scintilla.org/):
Made file dialog size configurable and keep their state.
Using a 400px wide dialog to select a file where character 250 differs is bad.
Especially if you work on a 3200x1200 dual head setting.

RedBook:

[argl] ... time to upgrade my wordpress... just lost 70% of this post.
Don't know which key I hit, but it was bad :(
