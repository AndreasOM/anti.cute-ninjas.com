    Yes,
    
    I'm still sick.
    
    The docs say I'm not, but they won't let me work till the end of the month,
    so there has to be "some" problem.
    
    This is starting to torture me ... mentally.
    
    If they'd say: "It'll hurt for the next 6 month, but then slowly disapear"
    things would be OK.
    But this "we can't find anything" is really wearing me out...
