(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Downgraded the chrooted system on blue2 (aka purple) to binutils 2.9.5.0.37-1 (the version from stable)<br />
    to be able to compile 2.4.18pre7.<br />
    <br />
    Will install grub now to be able to boot into the new system.<br />
    And then we'll see what breaks.<br />
    <br />
    (I installed blue2 (aka purple aka red) over 6 years ago and it grew from there,<br />
    so I'm not quite sure what is needed.)<br />
