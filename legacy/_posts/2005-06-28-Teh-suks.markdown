<h1>Teh suks</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Just got two emails.
    
    The <em>first</em> told me how proud our manangement is of the 250 million dollar deal the customer just signed (which is over 50% above the plan).
    The <em>second</em> told me that we won't get a salary increase ... due to the low sales...
    
    WTF?
    
    A 15 person team just made <strong>a quarter of a billion dollar</strong> and won't even get an <strong>inflation compensation</strong> ?
