<h1>Making money from you blog</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    There are a few ways to make (a little) money from your blog.
    
    I'm not into blogging for the money,
    but it's nice if the advertising at least covers the hosting costs.
    
    The most consistent cash I'm getting at the moment is from <a href="http://www.linkworth.com?a=886">Linkworth</a>
    
    It took about 5 days after signing up until my first advertiser applied for a link on one of my pages,
    but ever since then he stuck with me :)
