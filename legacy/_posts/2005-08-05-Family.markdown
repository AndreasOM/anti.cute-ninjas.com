<h1>Family</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Will visit my family over the weekend.
    
    Gonna pickup Kathring from work and then take the train to Duesseldorf.
    Fuel prices are so high right now, that it is cheaper to go by train...
    
    I never thought I'd say that.
    
    I wish I could call that vacation, but that's another story.
    Will visit my grandma ... and I think she's slowly loosing it.
    I still love her, so it's not that <em>hard</em> to stand those 4-6 hours....
