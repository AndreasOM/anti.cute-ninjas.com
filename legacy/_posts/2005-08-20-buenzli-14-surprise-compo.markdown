<h1>buenzli 14 - surprise compo</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Buenzli 14 had the usual surprise compo.
    Keywords were:
    police
    cheese
    fire salamander
    
    I couldn't stop myself from doing a little something.
    So I played around with blender a bit ... trying some of the new 2.37 features.
    
    The entry ended up abit late - as usual
    and a bit screwed up - as usual,
    but it looks like it might win ;)
    
    Here is a little shot:
    <img src="/news/images/fake-buenzli14-surprise.png" alt="Fake - Buenzli 14 - Surprise" />
    
    I'll upload a final onc eit has finished rendering,
    since I had to release a 75% Version with 5x OSA (instead of 16x)
    due to running late.
    
    <a href="http://buenz.li/">Buenzli</a> is a really nice little party.
    If you are interested in the demoscene at all, you should go there !
