<h1>More template work.</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I wasn't quite satisfied with the result so far,<br />
    so I reworked the templates a bit more.<br />
    <br />
    And I worked on the <a href="$(ROOT)/scene/history.html">fake/scene-history page</a>.<br />
