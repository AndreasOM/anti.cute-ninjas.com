<h1>Usefull Firefox settings</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Here are various settings that make browsing with Firefox a lot better ... for me.
    They have been gathered over quite some time from various resources.
    
    Start up Firefox and enter about:config in the location field.
    
    <strong>browser.xul.error_pages.enabled = true</strong>
    This way you don't get annoying popups if a request times out or a site doesn't exist.
    
    <strong>network.http.pipelining = true</strong>
    Allow to make multiple requests when retrieving pages.
    
    <strong>network.http.pipelining.maxrequests = 32</strong>
    Defines how many requests can be done in parallel.
    
    
    There are some more, but I'll have to filter them from my settings.
