<h1>morning warmup</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Since I skipped my workout yesterday and won't be able to exercise this evening,
    I decided to do at least "something" this morning.
    
    Ended up doing:
    100 Jumping Jacks
    40 Crunches
    100 hmmm ... whatdoyacallem ... "grabs" ... you know ... arms streched out and grab.
    
    It's not a lot,
    but I have to keep the flow
    while I'm very short on time...
