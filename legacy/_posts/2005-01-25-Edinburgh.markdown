<h1>Edinburgh</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I arrived in Edinburgh earlythis morning ... around 1am.
    The trip was OK. The only problem was that I had bustickets from the wrong "Glasgow International Airport".
    Well, I took the train and managed to get here.
    
    Today I had my first session with Bill.
    Can't say if I feel better yet, but he definitly pushed the right spots.
    And it seemed like he really understands the problem.
    
    I'll keep you posted.
