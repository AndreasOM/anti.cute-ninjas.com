    No updates for a while.<br />

    Worked on the scene <a href="http://www.webhome.de/anti/scene/members.html">members</a> and <a href="http://www.webhome.de/anti/scene/productions.html">productions.html</a> pages.<br />

    Upgraded to <a href="http://motion.technolust.cx/">motion 2.6.3</a>, so the readability of the time stamps on the <a href="http://www.webhome.de/anti/home/cam1.jpg">living room cam</a> should be much better now.<br />
    <br />
    I'm still in Denver.<br />
    Radix will move out next week, but he might have a replacement.<br />
