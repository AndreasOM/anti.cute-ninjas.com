(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    An lwn.net article pointed me to
    <a href="http://www.beatniksoftware.com/tomboy/">Tomboy</a>.
    
    Looks like it might solve all that problems with .txt being scattered all over my disk.
    And when I need something I don't find it.
    
    
    Just compiled and installed 0.2.2. No ebuild yet :(
    
    
    I'll give it a try and let you know ... in a while.
    
    <div class="edit">
    This is so tightly integrated with gnome,
    that I couldn't get it to be usefull with enlightenment.
    
    Dropped for now.
    </div>
