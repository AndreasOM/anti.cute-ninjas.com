(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Cool. I had that on my todo list for a while, but had planned to wait until after the Wordpress upgrade.
    And now I stumble upon Justins <a href="http://justinsomnia.org/2005/04/monthchunks-howto/">Month Chunks Plugin</a>.
    This was easy to install and looks so much better than a list with 50 entries.
    
    I still have to tweak the style a little, but it's a start.
