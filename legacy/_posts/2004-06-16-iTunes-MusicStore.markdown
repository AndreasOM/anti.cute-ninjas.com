<h1>iTunes MusicStore</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    OK,
    
    since the store is now finally available in germany I started to give it a try.
    
    First impressions.
    
    The software only works on OSX and Windows.
    But we have VMWare to help.
    
    Downloaded and installed the german version of the jukebox.
    Problem 1:
    Where the hell do I enter the store ?
    OK, located ... maybe I'm just blind.
    
    Problem 2:
    Why can I only create an US account ?
    OK, the "if you are outside the US click here"-button is simply to tiny.
    
    Problem 3:
    I'm used to filling out forms only using the keyboard. How do I focus the listboxes ?
    Not at all ? OK, let's click them :(
    
    I have an account ... let's start browsing...
