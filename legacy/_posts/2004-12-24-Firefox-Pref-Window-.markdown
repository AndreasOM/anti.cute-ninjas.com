<h1>Firefox - Pref Window.</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Finally someone decided to clean up the pile of junk:
    <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/ben/archives/007150.html">Inside Firefox - The Inside Track on Firefox Development</a>
    
    
    Don't get me wrong.
    Firefox is great, but the Prefs dialog is almost unusable...
