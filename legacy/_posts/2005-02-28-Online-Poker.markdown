<h1>Online Poker</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    It seems like I have the poker spam almost under control.
    
    But how about pushing the wikipedia page about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_poker" title="online poker">Online Poker</a> up in the search ranks, so the spammer can do what they want, but never reach the top ?!
    
    Help out.
