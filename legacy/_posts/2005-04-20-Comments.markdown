<h1>Comments</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    After reading <a href="http://www.coldforged.org/archives/2005/04/19/coldforgeds-wordpress-comment-template-deconstructed-part-1/">CF's</a> writup about his WP comment style, I just had to have it.
    
    Oh yeah ... I know that the sidebar on the "single" pages is broken, but I can't find where the bug is :(
