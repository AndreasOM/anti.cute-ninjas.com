<h1>Not Hitler</h1>
(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    I usually don't just post links to other blogs,
    but this one made me laugh:
    <a href="http://blog.simplychristel.net/index.php?/archives/53-guid.html">Name one way you are not Hitler...</a>
    
    I just wonder how it ended up on the gentoo world ;)
