(This post was autoconverted from the old news system,
it might look a little ... ugly until I find the time
to clean it up.
Sorry!)

    Just came back from the Mera Luna 2005.
    I've been to the Mera Luna a few times before,
    but this year it was the first year with a VIP ticket :)
    
    There were only about 21000 guest there this year,
    but I guess most of it was due to the bad weather.
    It was raining really bad on saturday.
    
    Most of the bands were quite good.
    <a href="http://www.cruxshadows.com/">Cruexshadows</a> were really great.
    You could really see that they were enjoying the show. Rogue kept climbing up the side of the stage,
    I guess some of the orgas were near to a heart attack with him being about 10 meters above the ground.
    
    <a href="http://69eyes.poko.fi/">The 69 eyes</a> had returned to their older - more glamour rock - style.
    The first comment I heard from the audience was "Omygod - they got fat.",
    the second one was "look at the hair ... is that a wig ?"
    They played OK, although the vocal were sometimes slightly off...
    
    <a href="http://mesh.co.uk/">Mesh</a> were really good -  as usual.
    Friends like these is still a killer song,
    but I start to prefer From this height.
    
    <a href="http://www.deine-lakaien.com/">Deine Lakaien</a> put on a good if somewhat short show.
    But at least Alexander wasn't stoned ... as some people claim after the special event in Hannover last friday.
    Ernst Horn showed once more that he is one of the greatest musicians ... ever!
    
    <a href="http://www.the-sisters-of-mercy.com/">The Sisters of Mercy</a> are getting old.
    There was a lot of smoke on the stage, so I can't say for sure if it was playback or live.
    The guitars were definitly live, but regarding Andrew Eldritch's singing, most of the people I talked to were pretty convinced that it wasn't live.
