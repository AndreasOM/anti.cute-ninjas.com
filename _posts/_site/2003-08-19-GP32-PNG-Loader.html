<p>This morning I had a big mouth,<br /> about being able to write a (simplistic) PNG loader<br /> that is working on the GP32.<br /> <br /> Now (5 hours later, including 20 minutes coding) I did it :)<br /> <br /> It&#8217;s not perfect.<br /> No&#8230;<br /> &#8230;interlaced images.<br /></p>

<p>&#8230;filtered images.<br /> &#8230;non indexed images.<br /> <br /> But more than enough for demos and games.<br /> <br /> get it <a href='http://anti.cute-ninjas.com/projects/gp32/fakepng-0.1.tar.gz'>here</a><br /></p>
