title: GP32 - PNG Loader
---

This morning I had a big mouth,<br/>
about being able to write a (simplistic) PNG loader<br/>
that is working on the GP32.<br/>
<br/>
Now (5 hours later, including 20 minutes coding) I did it :)<br/>
<br/>
It's not perfect.<br/>
No...<br/>
...interlaced images.<br/>

...filtered images.<br/>
...non indexed images.<br/>
<br/>
But more than enough for demos and games.<br/>
<br/>
get it <a href="http://anti.cute-ninjas.com/projects/gp32/fakepng-0.1.tar.gz">here</a><br/>
