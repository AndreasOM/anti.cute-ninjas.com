Well, the <u>real new news system</u> has replaced the old one long ago...

**Edit:**  
I removed the link to the "real new news system",  
since that obviously doesn't exist anymore.

It was a wordpress 1.5 installation,  
that I was using until the [switch to jekyll](/2010/01/29/Switching-To-Jekyll/).
