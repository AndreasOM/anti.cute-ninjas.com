Looking back at 2002.

Let's see what happened.

I was trying to [keep you entertained](/SHOTS/2002/01/22/17038/)

with
[linux stuff]({% post_url 2002-01-28-whatever %}),
[other linux stuff]({% post_url 2002-01-30-ooops %}),
[green]({% post_url 2002-02-04-Green %}) (which is just more linux stuff)
[nvidia]({% post_url 2002-02-09-nvidia %}) (linux stuff)
and a
[new harddisk]({% post_url 2002-04-22-BLUE2 %}) (for linux stuff) 60GB

[gkrellMMSi]({% post_url 2002-03-03-gkrellMMSi %}) was one of the tools that could have become huge, but I had major focus problems back then.

[stoned]({% post_url 2002-04-16-stoned %}) was idling around due to the same problems.

[evoke]({% post_url 2002-07-24-going-to-evoke- %}) was one of the demoscene parties I attended, but never managed to start any stuff (let's not even think about finishing).

[Restructuring]({% post_url 2002-08-22-Restructuring %}) of blog/site tools, the automization of this site has come a long way.
