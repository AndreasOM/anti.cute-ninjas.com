My first (surviving) blog entries are from August 2010.
This was ten years ago,
so I'll grab the chance
and start to look at them with some hindesight bias ;)

December 2010
Looking back it seems like I was more twittering than blogging back then.
Well, I should have seen the light and become rich, but I didn't.
Some posts about [buying CDs](/legacy/2000/12/04/Amazon/),
[coffee](/legacy/2000/12/04/Back-from-Coffee/) [breaks](/legacy/2000/12/04/Coffe-Break/)
my [Empeg MKII](/legacy/2000/12/04/Empeg/),
[waking up](/legacy/2000/12/04/Good-Morning/),
[java](/legacy/2000/12/04/Java/) which [suxs](/legacy/2000/12/04/Java-suxs/)
some posts about finishing [work](/legacy/2000/12/04/Leaving/)
and [lunch](/legacy/2000/12/04/Lunch/).

And more tweet like stuff.
And by December 6th I still didn't start an entry for [the party](/legacy/2000/12/06/the-party/).

All in all kinda boring.
But I wasn't yet ready to open up my private live to the world.

I was working in Hursley at IBM back then ensuring good communication between the Boeblingen and Hursley team.
The product was MQSeries Integrater, which later should become an integral part for banks and brokers.

My operating system of choice was GNU/Linux (Debian).
With Afterstep as the window manager.
I was hacking a lot of stuff in Perl and Shell (Bash)
and used C/C++ to write code.

In 2000 I was still on the "fastlane" which was IBM wording for "upper management soon".
I bailed out later, which I never really regretted, but didn't see coming back then.

Life was good;
And I was single...
