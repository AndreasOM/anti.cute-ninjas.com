I endured over 2 hours of Black Hawk Down.

Writing some code for the new game and had "The Rock" running in the background.  
When that ended "Black Hawk Down" started and I stopped coding.  
Years ago people were very enthusiastic about the movie.

# Disclaimer
While I do remember some of the real happenings from 1993 and I could have easily refreshed my memory by some research,
I decided to base the post entirly on the movie.

With the movie wo can talk about the facts.  
Reality has been twisted by politicians for nearly 20 years.

# The brief
This movie has to be one of the biggest pieces of shit ever filmed.

# The mission
US troops invade Mogadishu and kill civilians. Some of the troops survive and become heros.

You don't agree?

When the troops entered mogadishu they did so without an UN mandate and even without checking or informing their allies.  
They did so to kill Aidid. Not to extract and bring to justice. No, just to kill.

If I took 20 soldiers and entered texas to kill George W. Bush you would probably call that an invasion.  
It doesn't matter how many people Aidid killed.  
The mission was an invasion.

# US soldiers are stupid

First they talk about the mission which leads them into the most dangerous area in Africa.  
Next they decide to leave their flak jackets and other essential gear to avoid excess bagage.

Over the whole movie I saw about 20 scenes that would have a real soldier laugh or cry.  
There are some thing you simply never do:

* If one man is down and under fire in an open area, you cover him from a safe point.  
	You don't run back into rifle fire to "help".
* Watch your back. Don't keep staring in the wrong direction. Especially if nobody is covering your back.

I could go on and on, but I guess you just have to watch the movie to think "they are stupid".

# Colored people are evil
(Not my message! The one of the movie.)

So these somalian civilians get attacked by US soldiers without reason and start firing back.  
That's evil. If you are shot by a well feed, clean dressed US soldier, you better die!  
Don't protect your life or your family.

In one scene one of the soldiers shoots an unarmed civilian without any reason.  
What's the point?  
"I work for the good side, everything I do is right"?


# 19 americans are worth more than 1000 somalians
In the trailer each of the 19 dead soldiers is glorified.  
The 1000 dead civilians are mentioned as a sidenote in a single line.

# Conclusion
I wonder why a movie like this runs on television.  
Showing this to any under 18 year old should be considered a crime.
Showing this at all is stupid.

# Questions?
* The somalians had weapons, they must be evil ... or?  
	No. While I consider everybody owning a gun potentially evil,  
	I still consider civilians carrying a gun in a warzone *civilians*.  
	The soldiers are paid to kill.  
	The civilians just protect themselves.
