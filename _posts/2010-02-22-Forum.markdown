The omni-mad.com website needs a forum.
I have used phpBB in the past, but was more than dissatisfied with it on many occasions,
so I started to loom for other solutions.

A quick check at forum-matrix.org lead to this shortlist:

* [FUDforum](http://fudforum.org/)
* [MyBB](http://www.mybboard.net/)
* [NextBBS](http://www.nextbbs.com/)
* [Phorum](http://www.phorum.org/)
* [phpBB](http://www.phpbb.com/)
* [Vanilla](http://www.getvanilla.com/)

All non-Ruby and non-PHP forums where excluded.
All forums not supporting Postgres where excluded.
I wish they had info about Nginx support.

Let the elimination begin...

# Vanilla
The website looked slick, but took ages to load.
The "Community" area (Powered by Vanilla) didn't catch my eye at all. it felt a bit like the old phpBB 1.0.
Sorry. Vanilla is out.

# NextBBS
Fast load for their website, but it looked a bit .... lacking.
Fast load time in their forum (N2 powered), but didn't find the downloads and documentation.
Sorry. N2/NextBBS is gone.

# MyBB
Fast loading, good looking website.
Found the info I needed (docs + downloads ) very fast.
Even found the demo site immediatly, but ... nope. Loading didn't feel slick enough.

# phpBB
You knew this was coming ... didn't you?
Opened the phpBB demo/community forum. And that was it.
One look and I knew I just couldn't stand it.
It might be better than 1.x and 2.x, but the memories just spoiled it.

# Phorum
Not really sure why, but the karma coming from FUDforum just was better.
I might give phorum a try when I find some time for experimenting,
but right now I need something that works.

# FUDforum
The winner. So far. I will let you know in a few days if everything worked out.
