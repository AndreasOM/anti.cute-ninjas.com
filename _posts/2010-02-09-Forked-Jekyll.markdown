title: I just forked Jeyll
---

As you probably know I recently switched this site from wordpress and wml to jekyll.  
And while I really like what Jekyll does out of the box,  
I still have a few features that I would really use.

Since Jekyll is on github it's very easy to create your own fork.  
And maybe one day my addons will go back into the master tree :)

Right now I'm updating the ruby on my MacBook to be able to build the Jekyll gem.
