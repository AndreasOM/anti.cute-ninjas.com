Almost forgot to tell you.<br>
<br>
I finally switched to a real <u>"news system"</u>.

**Edit:**  
I removed the link to the "real new news system",  
since that obviously doesn't exist anymore.

It was a wordpress 1.x (x<5) installation,  
that I was using until the [switch to wordpress 1.5](/2005/09/13/News/).

Which was in turn [replaced by jekyll](/2010/01/29/Switching-To-Jekyll/).
