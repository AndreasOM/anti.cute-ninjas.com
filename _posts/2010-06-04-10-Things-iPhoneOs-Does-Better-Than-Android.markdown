title: "10 Things iPhone OS Does Better Than Android"
time: "10:00"

Ten weeks ago I switched to the Motorola Milestone as my main phone.

For the last to weeks I've been taking notes to write down my experiences with Android,
so this [Gizmodo Article](http://gizmodo.com/5554293/10-things-android-does-better-than-iphone-os) was just the kick I needed
to write it down for you.

## 1. iPhone OS only runs one application at a time.

Sure multitasking on a desktop PC or notebook is nice,
but on a phone I want to have full control over what is running (and sucking battery power).

The only thing I want running on my smartphone while I'm using an application is "the phone",
so I can always receive calls, no matter what I'm doing.
The only exeception to this rule might be the music player, so I don't have to carry around an extra MP3-player.

At the end of my workday I usually have around 6-8 apps running on my Android phone
and my battery is down to 5% (aka shutdown).

## 2. iPhone OS keeps your homescreen clean.

On my iPhone the apps are always nicely lined up in a grid and all icons have a common look.

On my Milestone I have to manually add the apps to the homescreen and no matter how hard I try
after a few days it looks like a child has turned over his box of legos.

I don't want to freedom to make a mess. Force me to keep it tidy!

## 3. iPhone has a better app market.

True, out of 200.000 apps in the iPhone market 95% are pure crap.
But, out of the 50.000 apps in the Android market 99.99999% (yes, 5 nines) are pure crap.

I love the fact that apple is tightening up their rules about application submission.
Yes, it will slow down the app number growth, but will improve the signal-to-noise ratio significantly.

And for all those who think censorship is bad,
go talk to those []Android Tetris Developers](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2010/06/google-blocks-tetris-clones-from-android-market.ars).

## 4. iPhone status bar is cleaner.

My android status bar usually contains about 10-15 icons. Around 8 of these I just can't remember the meaning of.
(Friends tell me this gets worse once you install more apps.)

My iPhone status bar contains network-quality, time and battery. What else do I need?
Remember: It's a phone!

## 5. iPhone has fixed hardware.

As a developer Android is a total nightmare.
Every day you get new hardware.
The CPU performance changes, the memory size changes, the screen resolution and aspect ration keeps changing.
Hitting one moving target is hard, but hitting 200 moving targets is impossible.
Which might explain the low quality of android apps.

## 6. iPhone supports all carriers.

At least in europe, but so does Android.

## 7. There is only one iPhone OS.

Again (like the hardware problem): To many different paremeters make development and consitency very hard.
The consumer will suffer from this.

## 8. iPhone has a single place for settings
Android scatters your settings all over the place and some of them are only reachable via extra apps/widgets.

I spent over an hour looking for the facebook app setting for the resolution of uploaded photos.
It doesn't exist.
On my iPhone I open settings, go to facebook and there it is.

## 9. iPhone has better social integration.

iPhone has an official twitter app with push notification.
iPhone has an official facebook app.
iPhone has it's own social network.

## 10. iPhone is cheaper.

In the first 10 weeks with my Mileston I spent more than twice on apps what I spent in 2 years in the iPhone appstore.
And I don't have everything I need yet.

Hardware cost is the same and (european) carriers have the same data plans for both.


All in all a clear win for iPhone so far.
