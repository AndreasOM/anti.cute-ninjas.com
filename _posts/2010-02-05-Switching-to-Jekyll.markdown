title: Switching To Jekyll
time: "18:30"
---

Last week I wrote that I'm [switching to jekyll](/2010/01/29/Switching-To-Jekyll/) and now the time for the switchover has come.

The pages still don't like I want them to look,
but I feel that they look good enough to replace the old site.

This will also mean I'm moving to a new server.
(The old one has been running since 2004 and is getting a bit dated.)

This will also mean a switch from Apache to NGINX.

Cut me some slack and give me some time to really clean things up.
As long as the text is readable you will find what you need.
