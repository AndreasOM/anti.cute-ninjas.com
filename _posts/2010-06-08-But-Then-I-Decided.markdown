title: But then I decided ...

... that my place was just too small.

For the last 3 years we've been living in a single room 30sqm (~323sqft) flat.
It's on the top floor of a 11 story building and has a magnificient view,
but still 30sqm is just not enough for two (and a half).

The other problem is that shared between the two of us we have to drive around
160km (~100miles) ... per day. Resulting in over 3000km (~1864miles) per month or 36000km (~22370miles) per year.
That's a lot of gas - and not very "green".

So in October last year we wanted to change that.
Easier said than done, since our budget for the change was around -200 Euros,
yes, that's _minus_ 200 Euros. We were already overspending, but that's a different story.

And we wanted to change it big time. Not just _doubling_ up to 60sqm (~646sqft) and two rooms
or _tripling_ to 90sqm (~969sqft) and three rooms. _No_,

* we wanted big.
* And we wanted to fix the driving problem.
* And we wanted to fix the overspending.

So what did we do?

We _decided_ to change it.

(And you can quote me on that!)

_Yes_,

* we spent _9_ _month_ looking at
* _thousands_ of offers online and 
* checking about _200_ candidates,

but in the end we made it.

In three weeks we'll get the keys to our new loft.

* It has more than _4 times_ the old size (>120sqm, ~1292sqft).
* It has more than 4 rooms.
* It saves us around 100km (~62miles) per _day_, that's over 1900km (~1180miles) per month or 22800km (~14167miles) per year.

Oh and I nearly forgot.
(If we combine the slightly higher rent with the saved driving costs and "other" stuff, e.g. uneeded external storage)

*  It saves us >300 Euros per month.

And all we needed to do was
