Tweaking my templates to do what they are supposed to do.

I'm trying to stay away from reading the (Jekyll-)code to understand how to do things.
The documentation should really be enough.

So far I have some workaround tweaks, but nothing satisfying.

Including snippets via liquid is still a little confusing.


Lunchbreak is over, so I have to get back to some real world.
