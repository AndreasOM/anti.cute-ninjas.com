A few weeks ago I explained how making decision lead to a new place to live ([But then I decided](/2010/06/08/But-Then-I-Decided/).

A little more than a year ago when I started to work for Gameforge,
I walked past the building and said to myself "I want that corner office."

It was the office of our CEO Alexander RÃ¶sner.
So what I really was thinking was "I want to become the CEO."

I deciced on the spot to get that office.
Only realizing my mistake just a few days ago.

Last week on monday we did the usual round of office sokoban
and by pure luck - well, I had _decided_ - I got exactly that office.

The lesson learned?

Be clear when you decide.
Your subconsciousness will listen to you,
but it will hear what you say, not what you mean.


My next decision?
Become the CTO.
