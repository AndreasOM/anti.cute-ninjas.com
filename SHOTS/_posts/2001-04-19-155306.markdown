This is me learning Gtk+Perl again.

In the upper right corner is the dialog that is opened when I click on the clock in my GKrellm.

**Note:**
This whole setup including the script was lost during my big harddisk crash :(

[**Edit:** added in 2010]
 I had a big harddisk crash in 2002 and managed to overwrite the backups with the data from the broken disk.
Since the my backup strategy has been improved a lot ;)
