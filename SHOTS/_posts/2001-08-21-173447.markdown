I like the new Buell.

Tried to compile light, but that seems to need Mozilla compiled by hand. 
So I did that over at Blue (much faster) and wget-ed the result. (hmmm... 106%??)

**Note:** Added on February 6th 2010
Blue was on of the first servers I owned.  
Back then I started to spray paint the cases of the PCs  
and named the systems after their color.

The first few ...  as I remember:
* Blue
* Green
* Red
* Yellow
* White (G4 Mac Book, still in use by Kathrin)
* Platinum (Quad Core Vista System with 1TB RAID5 and 4GB of RAM. My Windows system and thus almost always off.)
* Snow (Well, white was taken, my MacBook, still in use by me. I'm typing this on it right now)
