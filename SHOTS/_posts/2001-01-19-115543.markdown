[**Note:** I'm writing these lines in 2010, since the original shot hat no description!]

I was still working on the [screenshot tool](/SHOTS/2001/01/18/141432/).

As you can see in the background (upper left) I did quite some testing.

In the other terminal (lower left) it looks like I'm transfering an ISO for a debian install CD.
(Nevermind the "mp3_real" directory, that was only my CD collection.)

In the texteditor ([SciTE](http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html)) you can see that even back then I
used a statically generated website (check [WML](http://thewml.org/)).
I guess everything goes in circles.
