upper left:
I just got my NexII (frontierlabs.com) and have to write some 'ease of use' tools.

bottom:
I did a chrooted debian installation on purples 2nd disk. I want to remove the old slow one, all that's left is the right kernel.

right side:
(gkrellm) I wrote a small plugin that displays an icon for the current xmms song.

upper right:
yahoo-messenger.
I don't like it, but some of my friends use it...
